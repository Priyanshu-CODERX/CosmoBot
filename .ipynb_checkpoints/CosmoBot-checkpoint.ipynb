      "\n",
      "How do we know that gravitational waves exist?\n",
      "In 2015, scientists detected gravitational waves for the very first time. They used a very sensitive instrument called LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). These first gravitational waves happened when two black holes crashed into one another. The collision happened 1.3 billion years ago. But, the ripples didnâ€™t make it to Earth until 2015!\n",

The observatory uses lasers, mirrors, and extremely sensitive instruments to detect these tiny changes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Where did asteroids come from?\n",
      "Asteroids are left over from the formation of our solar system. Our solar system began about 4.6 billion years ago when a big cloud of gas and dust collapsed. When this happened, most of the material fell to the center of the cloud and formed the sun.\n",

Then, the Dawn spacecraft traveled to the asteroid belt in 2011 to orbit and study the second largest object there, Vesta. Vesta is so large it's like a small planet. In 2012 Dawn left Vesta and went into orbit around the largest object in the asteroid belt, dwarf planet Ceres.\n",

Unlike our spiral galaxy, this one lacks a clean spiral shape. Some scientists think that is because the Milky Way and other galaxies are pulling and warping it.\n",

      "Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that involves the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future. According to NASA, the definition of cosmology is \"the scientific study of the large scale properties of the universe as a whole.\"\n",

      "Cosmologists puzzle over exotic concepts like string theory, dark matter and dark energy and whether there is one universe or many (sometimes called the multiverse).

      "Humanity's understanding of the universe has evolved significantly over time. In the early history of astronomy, Earth was regarded as the center of all things, with planets and stars orbiting it. In the 16th century, Polish scientist Nicolaus Copernicus suggested that Earth and the other planets in the solar system in fact orbited the sun, creating a profound shift in the understanding of the cosmos. In the late 17th century, Isaac Newton calculated how the forces between planets â€” specifically the gravitational forces â€” interacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dawn of the 20th century brought further insights into comprehending the vast universe. Albert Einstein proposed the unification of space and time in his General Theory of Relativity. In the early 1900s, scientists were debating whether the Milky Way contained the whole universe within its span, or whether it was simply one of many collections of stars. Edwin Hubble calculated the distance to a fuzzy nebulous object in the sky and determined that it lay outside of the Milky Way, proving our galaxy to be a small drop in the enormous universe. Using General Relativity to lay the framework, Hubble measured other galaxies and determined that they were rushing away from the us, leading him to conclude that the universe was not static but expanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent decades, cosmologist Stephen Hawking determined that the universe itself is not infinite but has a definite size. However, it lacks a definite boundary. This is similar to Earth; although the planet is finite, a person traveling around it would never find the \"end\" but would instead constantly circle the globe. Hawking also proposed that the universe would not continue on forever but would eventually end.\n",

      "Although NASA's Hubble Space Telescope is probably best known for its astounding images, a primary mission was cosmological. By more accurately measuring the distances to Cepheid variables, stars with a well-defined ratio between their brightness and their pulsations, Hubble helped to refine measurements regarding how the universe is expanding. Since its launch, astronomers have continued to use Hubble to make cosmological measurements and refine existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to Hubble, \"If you put in a box all the ways that dark energy might differ from the cosmological constant, that box would now be three times smaller,\" cosmologist Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute said in a statement. \"That's progress, but we still have a long way to go to pin down the nature of dark energy.\"\n",

      "No, because if we were to travel to a distant galaxy, it would seem that all surrounding galaxies were similarly rushing away. Think of the universe as a giant balloon. If you mark multiple points on the balloon, then blow it up, you would note that each point is moving away from all of the others, though none are at the center.

      "Will the universe end? If so, how?\n",
      "Whether or not the universe will come to an end depends on its density â€” how spread out the matter within it might be. Scientists have calculated a \"critical density\" for the universe. If its true density is greater than their calculations, eventually the expansion of the universe will slow and then, ultimately, reverse until it collapses. However, if the density is less than the critical density, the universe will continue to expand forever. [More: How the Universe Will End]\n",

When we opened our eyes and looked up, the universe had already gone through most of its transitions, and we would never be able to see or understand a few of them. Does the universe have a purpose? What is the origin of intelligence? Are we alone? What is the meaning of human consciousness? What is the fate of our universe? Such questions remind us that when it comes to the universe, the most straightforward questions are often the most complex ones. We are still on the hunt for solutions that could describe our questions, let alone finding their answers.\n",
      "There is a long list of cosmic lovers who devoted their entire life trying to unlock the mysteries of the universe. Sir Isaac Newton helped shape our very first clear picture of the universe. With his discovery of gravitation, we were able to understand the physical interactions taking place around us, such as the workings of our solar system and why the moon does not fall to the Earth. However, a lot of unanswered questions remained. That is where our role model, Albert Einstein came in. Einstein successfully polished our view with his Theory of Relativity, and even a century later, we continue to use his work.\n",

Aliens (if any) living 65 million light-years away looking at Earth would see dinosaurs ruling the planet. To understand the outer universe, we created the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Telescope, etc., whereas to understand the inner universe, we created giant machines like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Todayâ€™s advancements in physics, biology, math, and other areas aim to provide us a quality life and prepare us for what will prove to be humanityâ€™s most significant battle, i.e., preserving the very spark of life in this universe.\n",

The earliest telescopes were the refracting telescopes that originated in 1608 in the Netherlands. Telescopes have rapidly revolutionized our knowledge of the universe, which in turn has changed human history drastically. The Big Bang explosion was the beginning of fundamental pillars that will support life after billions of years. Life grew in the lap of the universe; today, we are sure about the presence of life on at least one planet, i.e., Earth. However, in the coming future, we can hope to uncover life at many more planets, not in the form of a little green man with big eyes and a small mouth but in terms of the type of civilization similar to ours.\n",

The only difference is that the universe itself governs this time machine, and the universe has its own laws and parameters to govern it.

      "74\n",
      "BABY UNIVERSE\n",
      "1. It is possible that dark matter could be an undiscovered\n",
      "particle, but it does not act like any particle we know so far.\n",
      "We know it is there because of its gravitational influence. If it\n",
      "is a particle, one thing we know is that it can interact with us\n",
      "in the form of gravity. What the nature of this particle is and\n",
      "what it is made up of is a point of discussion. If it is made up\n",
      "of a different kind of particle, that would open a new branch of\n",
      "physics for scientists to study.\n",
      "2. Another possibility is that our existing understanding of\n",
      "gravity is incomplete. Our current theories break down when\n",
      "we talk about the gravity of dark matter. Everything we know\n",
      "about matter comes from the understanding of its gravitational\n",
      "effects. Einstein explained gravity as the curve in space-time\n",

      "it interacts with ordinary matter is in the form of its gravity,\n",
      "so once our understanding of gravity is complete, we might be\n",
      "able to tell what dark matter is.\n",
      "3. The next reason why dark matter does not directly interact\n",
      "with any particle could be that it is not from our 3-dimensional\n",
      "world. Some scientists predict that dark matter could be a\n",
      "force field from a higher dimension whose gravity is somehow\n",
      "leaking into our dimensions. If that is the case, it proves that\n",
      "gravity can travel between multiple dimensions and connect us\n",

So, what is the rest of the 68% of our universe made of?\n",
      "The answer comes in the form of dark energyâ€”the energy of darkness or the energy of vacuum itself. The concept of dark energy was first revealed by Albert Einstein. However, at that time, the static model of the universe was more widely accepted by the scientific community. Theoretically, Einstein was able to determine that our universe must be expanding, but that idea did not fit well with the other known cosmological facts of that time. So, to give a static model of the universe (a universe that is not expanding), Einstein dropped his idea of the expanding universe and added a new term to his equations, the cosmological constant.\n",

      "â€œquintessence.â€\n",
      "2. Another possibility is that our current understanding\n",
      "of gravity is incomplete. Our current model of gravity only\n",
      "includes the gravity of matter and dark matter. The force of\n",
      "dark energy could be another part of gravity, just opposite in\n",
      "nature.\n",
      "3. The leading theory, however, considers dark energy as a\n",
      "property of space itself. It predicts that empty space can have\n",
      "its own energy, and this indicates that as more space emerges,\n",
      "more energy is added to the universe, increasing its expansion.\n",

      "Early Stars and Galaxies\n",
      "At the beginning of our universe, stars were formed when a large amount of dust and gases came together. It is not an easy process for stars to shine and show us their bright light. Gravity plays a significant role in this process. The early stars started shining as soon as Hydrogen started to fuse into Helium due to the gravitational force of the star. The outside gravitational force of a star not only provides extra pressure for Hydrogen atoms to fuse into Helium and other heavy elements but also raises the inner core temperature of a star, which makes the process easier.\n",
      "Early stars in our universe used to be very big compared to our Sun because their formation took place in the early pure Hydrogen clouds. Due to gravitational forces, some of those stars kept on adding more and more matter and went on becoming denser and heavier. As they became big, they added more matter to their pile. Some of those early giant stars ended up as a supernova explosion creating heavier elements. It is believed that most of the heavy elements such as Iron and Gold that we use today came from the explosion of those stars that formed soon after the Big Bang. Not all stars exploded into a supernova, some of them contracted under their own gravity resulting in the formation of massive Black Holes.\n",

      "giant stars; most of which exploded and gave us heavier\n",
      "elements floating everywhere. Early universe was smaller\n",
      "and much denser, so those early Black Holes started sucking\n",

As we spread our arms more in-depth into the universe, we observe the beauty it is confined with and witness the impossible things happening out there. Scientists speak in a different tone when it comes to a black hole. For some, they could be the pathways to new dimensions, whereas for others, black holes are nothing but an ultra-dense space which does not let anything come out. Black holes contain one of the mysterious places of the universe that are beyond our reach, a singularity.\n",
      "Black holes were suggested by the astronomical pioneer John Michell. He predicted that when a body is so dense that its escape velocity is close to the speed of light, it will turn into a black hole. He said that we could only observe them by their gravitational effects. A few months later, when Einstein developed his theory of relativity, Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to Einsteinâ€™s equations explaining the gravitational field of a spherical point mass. Based on the explanation given by Albert Einstein, the black hole curves the space-time fabric more than anything else because of their infinite density. We can say black holes curve space-time, and as light travels through that curved space, it bends forever and is never able to come out of that region.

At the very centre of that gas cloud, a new star was being born, and that was our Sun. Five billion years ago from today, there was no sign for a thing called a planet, let alone a blue planet. However, as the solar dust cleared, gravity began to cause bits of matter to clump together, forming a large number of planets, and there was a beautiful structure around this newly born star.

Some of them collided with each other forming bigger planets whereas others fell into the Sun.\n",

Even though the early solar systemâ€™s dramatic conditions have destroyed almost all the evidence, a few of them are still here. The earliest rocks give us the fingerprints of volcanic activity that occurred in the beginning and the transitions our planet has gone through. Geologists hunt for such rocks to reveal the baby picture of the Earth and how it looked back then. At the beginning of the solar system, a large number of planets were born. Some planets destroyed themselves and others as well, some kept on growing by adding more mass to their pile. As smaller planets came into their path, they became their moons. In our case, Jupiter has over 79 known moons; most of them were captured by its gravity.\n",

At that time, if you stood on Earth, you would get submerged in lava and die instantly due to the heat. Earth was getting bombarded by a large number (millions) of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids every day. That was one of the reasons preventing Earth from cooling down quickly.

      "Sister theory suggests that during the formation of our solar\n",
      "system, the Moon formed as a separate object near Earth. The\n",

      "the problem was that it did not have a stable orbit to revolve\n",

      "Mercury or Venus in the way.\n",
      "Flaw in the Capture Theory\n",
      "The main problem with Capture Theory is the abnormal mass\n",
      "of our Moon. For us, Earth might seem like a big planet, but in\n",
      "the scale of the solar system, it is tiny. If the Moon was formed\n",
      "away from the Earth, it must have a very high momentum\n",

      "impact. There are many chances for a big object like our Moon\n",
      "to alter the stable orbit of Earth if moving with considerable\n",

      "of collisions were prevalent in the early solar system.\n",
      "It was not a direct face to face impact; both planets touched each\n",
      "other and continued moving on their path. This impact was so\n",
      "horrible that millions of tons of matter acquired the escape\n",
      "velocity and escaped into outer space, while the rest stayed in\n",
      "orbit around Earth. The impact increased the spinning rate of\n",
      "Earth; a day took just six hours for completion. This collision\n",
      "resulted in the formation of a lava belt around Earth. As time\n",

The sky used to be very clear with many distant twinkling stars. My mother used to tell me that all these twinkling stars are our relatives. When people die, they become a star in the sky. My mother used to point out different stars and tell us, â€˜this star is your grandmother, and all the rest are other relatives.â€™ In my village, people believed that Earth was supported by the horn of a cow, and earthquakes occurred when the cow shifted Earth from one horn to another.\n",

This could mean two things: Either God does not exist, or maybe God was not happy with the way I was praying. For me, like all my family, there used to be someone in the sky who created us and controlled everything. Lightning used to mean that God was angry, and rain used to mean that God was happy with our prayers.

      "is not just expanding but also accelerating. The culprit behind\n",

      "the form of gravity. Scientists measured the distortion caused\n",

Some men stood for themselves and questioned the existence of God even though they might fear that if there is a god, they will go straight to hell.

When I see so much suffering in the outside world, people dying in floods while others die in droughts without water, I want to question the existence of a personal god above the clouds.

      "We have created milestones in the history of humanity, but we are still confused if there is a purpose to all that. This question has been bothering us long before we started understanding the language of the universe. In the pursuit of finding a purpose, we have created our own different personal gods. Our understanding about God might have changed in the last 1000 years, but we are still clueless if the universe has a purpose. The meaning of purpose is the reason for which something was created or for which something exists. When we look deeper into the universe, we do not seem to find a reason for the existence of the cosmos. Maybe it was created for a reason, but it is too complicated for us to find out. Whenever we talk about the purpose of the universe, scientists have two different opinions:\n",
      "The first group of scientists believe that the universe has a purpose. These scientists believe in Godâ€™s existence; some believe in the personal God, whereas others believe in the universal God as most of them are spiritual. Moreover, the God who created all of us must have a plan of why he created us. The universe has a purpose because lives, from their very first spark, are governed by various laws of nature which drive\n",

      "from an atom to the solar system and the giant galaxies, we\n",

      "lives, and we must be thankful for that. In the end, maybe a\n",
      "billion years from now, we will find the purpose, and even if\n",
      "we do not, we must keep giving ourselves new purposes in the\n",
      "form of small tasks and keep this cycle going.\n",

      "A true physicist, mathematician, astronomer and natural philosopher, Sir Isaac Newton is considered as one of the most influential scientists ever lived on this planet. Born on December 25th, 1642, in Woolsthorpe, England, Sir Isaac Newton is commonly known for discovering the universal law of Gravitation. Sir Newton was born the same year Galileo Galilei died. During his childhood, Sir Isaac Newton was not a good student at all. After his stepfather died, his mother wanted him to become a farmer. But little Newton was not good at farming, so he was sent back to school. If he were good at farming, he would have stayed at home, and it would take probably another hundred years for scientists to discover gravity. When he was 22, Newton developed the generalized Binomial Theorem. After graduation, Newton spent the next two years at home developing his theories on Optics, Calculus and his universal laws on Gravitation.\n",
      "It is said that during The Great Plague of London, which lasted from 1665 to 1666, Newton discovered the laws of Gravitation. Quarantine at home gave him time to work on his theories and to develop new laws. If the plague had not happened, we might have missed some of the most significant works of Sir Isaac Newton. A few months after getting his undergraduate degree at 23 years of age, Newton went back to his family farm. That\n",

      "causing us to stay on the surface of Earth. Moreover, the same\n",

years ago, a great scientist named albert einstein came up with many ideas about gravity and space.\\n\\neinstein predicted that something special happens when two bodiesâ€”such as planets or starsâ€”orbit each other. he believed that this kind of movement could cause ripples in space. these ripples would spread out like the ripples in a pond when a stone is tossed in. scientists call these ripples of space gravitational waves.\\n\\ngravitational waves are invisible. however, they are incredibly fast. they travel at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second). gravitational waves squeeze and stretch anything in their path as they pass by.\\n\\nthe most powerful gravitational waves are caused when objects move at very high speeds. some examples of events that could cause a gravitational wave are:\\n\\nwhen a star explodes asymmetrically (called a supernova)\\nwhen two big stars orbit each other\\nwhen two black holes orbit each other and merge\\n\\n\\nan artistâ€™s animation of gravitational waves created by the merger of two black holes. credit: ligo/t. pyle\\n\\nbut these types of objects that create gravitational waves are far away. and sometimes, these events only cause small, weak gravitational waves. the waves are then very weak by the time they reach earth. this makes gravitational waves hard to detect.\\n\\n\\nhow do we know that gravitational waves exist?\\nin 2015, scientists detected gravitational waves for the very first time. they used a very sensitive instrument called ligo (laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory). these first gravitational waves happened when two black holes crashed into one another. the collision happened 1.3 billion years ago. but, the ripples didnâ€™t make it to earth until 2015!\\n\\nan aerial photo of the ligo observatory in hanford, washington\\nligo is made up of two observatories: one in louisiana and one in washington (above). each observatory has two long â€œarmsâ€ that are each more than 2 miles (4 kilometers) long. credit: caltech/mit/ligo lab\\n\\neinstein was right!\\nthe first detection of gravitational waves was a very important event in science. before this, just about everything we knew about the universe came from studying waves of light. now we have a new way to learn about the universeâ€”by studying waves of gravity.\\n\\ngravitational waves will help us learn many new things about our universe. we may also learn more about gravity itself!\\n\\n\\nhow are gravitational waves detected?\\nwhen a gravitational wave passes by earth, it squeezes and stretches space. ligo can detect this squeezing and stretching. each ligo observatory has two â€œarmsâ€ that are each more than 2 miles (4 kilometers) long. a passing gravitational wave causes the length of the arms to change slightly. the observatory uses lasers, mirrors, and extremely sensitive instruments to detect these tiny changes.\\n\\nasteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun. although asteroids orbit the sun like planets, they are much smaller than planets.\\nthere are lots of asteroids in our solar system. most of them live in the main asteroid beltâ€”a region between the orbits of mars and jupiter.\\n\\nmost asteroids in our solar system can be found in the asteroid belt, between mars and jupiter.\\n\\nasteroids hang out in other places, too. for example, some asteroids are found in the orbital path of planets. this means that the asteroid and the planet follow the same path around the sun. earth and a few other planets have asteroids like this.\\n\\nwhere did asteroids come from?\\nasteroids are left over from the formation of our solar system. our solar system began about 4.6 billion years ago when a big cloud of gas and dust collapsed. when this happened, most of the material fell to the center of the cloud and formed the sun.\\n\\nsome of the condensing dust in the cloud became planets. the objects in the asteroid belt never had the chance to be incorporated into planets. they are leftovers from that time long ago when planets formed.\\n\\n\\nare all asteroids the same?\\nno way! because asteroids formed in different locations at different distances from the sun, no two asteroids are alike. here are a few ways that they differ:\\n\\nasteroids arenâ€™t all round like planets. they have jagged and irregular shapes.\\n\\nsome asteroids are hundreds of miles in diameter, but many more are as small as pebbles.\\n\\nmost asteroids are made of different kinds of rocks, but some have clays or metals, such as nickel and iron.\\n\\nimages of three asteroids, mathilde, gaspra, and ida, showing the variability in asteroid size and shape.\\nmathilde, gaspra, and ida are three asteroids that have been imaged by nasa spacecraft. in this image, you can see that asteroids come in a variety shapes and sizes. image credit: nasa/jpl\\n\\n\\nwhat can we learn from asteroids?\\nsince asteroids formed at the same time as other objects in our solar system, these space rocks can give scientists lots of information about the history of planets and the sun. scientists can learn about asteroids by studying meteorites: tiny bits of asteroids that have flown through our atmosphere and landed on earthâ€™s surface.\\n\\nseveral nasa space missions have also flown by and observed asteroids. the near shoemaker spacecraft landed on eros, an asteroid near earth, in 2001. then, the dawn spacecraft traveled to the asteroid belt in 2011 to orbit and study the second largest object there, vesta. vesta is so large it\\'s like a small planet. in 2012 dawn left vesta and went into orbit around the largest object in the asteroid belt, dwarf planet ceres.\\n\\nin 2016, nasa launched the osiris-rex spacecraft to study an asteroid near earth named bennu and bring a sample of the asteroid back to earth! in 2018, osiris-rex went into orbit around bennu. bennu is the smallest world ever to be orbited by spacecraft. osiris-rex will spend two years studying bennuâ€™s surface, looking for the best place to take a sample.\\n\\nwhat is a satellite galaxy?\\nwhat is a satellite galaxy?\\nour sun is part of a massive collection of stars in the milky way galaxy. these hundreds of billions of stars orbit the galaxyâ€™s center. but did you know that there are things that are even bigger orbiting the milky wayâ€™s center? other galaxies orbit it too!\\n\\npicture of the andromeda galaxy with two satellite galaxies surrounding it. labled.\\nthe andromeda galaxy with two satellite galaxies surrounding it. original image credit: boris å\\xa0tromar.\\n\\nthese less massive galaxies have their own impressive collection of stars, which all orbit their own center; but the galaxies and everything in them orbit our galaxy too. itâ€™s as if our galaxy is the sun and those other galaxies are planets. astronomers call them â€œsatellite galaxies.â€\\n\\n\\nwhere are they and what are they like?\\nimage of the large magellanic cloud\\nthe large magellanic cloud\\n\\nthe milky way has a number of satellite galaxies, but the biggest one is the large magellanic cloud. it is about 163,000 light-years away and around 1/100th the size of the milky way. unlike our spiral galaxy, this one lacks a clean spiral shape. some scientists think that is because the milky way and other galaxies are pulling and warping it.\\n\\nin terms of distance, there are two contenders for closest satellite galaxy. one group of stars is small enough that astronomers consider it a â€œdwarf galaxy.â€ the other group is so close that they still debate whether or not it is part of our galaxy or its own dwarf galaxy.\\n\\nastronomers have named the one that everyone agrees on the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. itâ€™s about 50,000 light-years away from the milky way center. it orbits over the top and down below the disk of our galaxy, like a ring over a spinning top.\\n\\nbut there is something even closer to our milky wayâ€”a cluster of stars named by some to be the canis major dwarf galaxy. scientists estimate that it contains around a billion stars. it is so close to the edge of the milky way that it is closer to our solar system than to our galaxyâ€™s center. itâ€™s about 25,000 light-years away from us.\\n\\n\\nwhere does one galaxy start and the other end?\\nsome scientists donâ€™t think the canis major cluster of stars is actually its own galaxy or dwarf galaxy. instead they think it is just a dense area of faraway stars that are still part of the milky way. either way, it is clear that this bunch of stars has been pulled very close to our milky way by our galaxyâ€™s massive gravity. over time, this could be the fate of other satellite galaxies in the area. they could all one day merge into an even larger milky way galaxy!\\ncosmology is a branch of astronomy that involves the origin and evolution of the universe, from the big bang to today and on into the future. according to nasa, the definition of cosmology is \"the scientific study of the large scale properties of the universe as a whole.\"\\n\\ncosmologists puzzle over exotic concepts like string theory, dark matter and dark energy and whether there is one universe or many (sometimes called the multiverse). while other aspects astronomy deal with individual objects and phenomena or collections of objects, cosmology spans the entire universe from birth to death, with a wealth of mysteries at every stage. \\nhistory of cosmology & astronomy\\nhumanity\\'s understanding of the universe has evolved significantly over time. in the early history of astronomy, earth was regarded as the center of all things, with planets and stars orbiting it. in the 16th century, polish scientist nicolaus copernicus suggested that earth and the other planets in the solar system in fact orbited the sun, creating a profound shift in the understanding of the cosmos. in the late 17th century, isaac newton calculated how the forces between planets â€” specifically the gravitational forces â€” interacted.\\n\\nthe dawn of the 20th century brought further insights into comprehending the vast universe. albert einstein proposed the unification of space and time in his general theory of relativity. in the early 1900s, scientists were debating whether the milky way contained the whole universe within its span, or whether it was simply one of many collections of stars. edwin hubble calculated the distance to a fuzzy nebulous object in the sky and determined that it lay outside of the milky way, proving our galaxy to be a small drop in the enormous universe. using general relativity to lay the framework, hubble measured other galaxies and determined that they were rushing away from the us, leading him to conclude that the universe was not static but expanding.\\n\\nin recent decades, cosmologist stephen hawking determined that the universe itself is not infinite but has a definite size. however, it lacks a definite boundary. this is similar to earth; although the planet is finite, a person traveling around it would never find the \"end\" but would instead constantly circle the globe. hawking also proposed that the universe would not continue on forever but would eventually end.\\n\\ncosmological missions & instruments\\nlaunched in november 1989, nasa\\'s cosmic background explorer (cobe) took precise measurements of radiation across the sky. the mission operated until 1993.\\n\\nalthough nasa\\'s hubble space telescope is probably best known for its astounding images, a primary mission was cosmological. by more accurately measuring the distances to cepheid variables, stars with a well-defined ratio between their brightness and their pulsations, hubble helped to refine measurements regarding how the universe is expanding. since its launch, astronomers have continued to use hubble to make cosmological measurements and refine existing ones.\\n\\nthanks to hubble, \"if you put in a box all the ways that dark energy might differ from the cosmological constant, that box would now be three times smaller,\" cosmologist adam riess of the space telescope science institute said in a statement. \"that\\'s progress, but we still have a long way to go to pin down the nature of dark energy.\"\\n\\nnasa\\'s wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) was a spacecraft that operated from 2001 to 2010. wmap mapped tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (cmb), the ancient light from the early universe, and determined that ordinary atoms make up only 4.6 percent of the universe, while dark matter makes up 24 percent.\\n\\n\"lingering doubts about the existence of dark energy and the composition of the universe dissolved when the wmap satellite took the most detailed picture ever of the cosmic microwave background,\" said cosmologist charles seife in the journal science.\\n\\nthe european space agency\\'s planck space mission ran from 2009 to 2013 and continued the study of the cosmic microwave background.\\n\\nthe esa is currently developing the euclid mission, which should fly by the end of the decade. euclid will study dark matter and dark energy with greater precision, tracing its distribution and evolution through the universe.\\n\\n\"at the heart of the mission is one of the billion pound questions of physics,\" the esa\\'s david parker said in a statement.\\n\\nwhat came before the big bang?\\nbecause of the enclosed and finite nature of the universe, we cannot see \"outside\" of our own universe. space and time began with the big bang. while there are a number of speculations about the existence of other universes, there is no practical way to observe them, and as such there will never be any evidence for (or against!) them.\\n\\nwhere did the big bang happen?\\nthe big bang did not happen at a single point but instead was the appearance of space and time throughout the entire universe at once.\\n\\nif other galaxies all seem to be rushing away from us, doesn\\'t that place us at the center of the universe?\\nno, because if we were to travel to a distant galaxy, it would seem that all surrounding galaxies were similarly rushing away. think of the universe as a giant balloon. if you mark multiple points on the balloon, then blow it up, you would note that each point is moving away from all of the others, though none are at the center. the expansion of the universe functions in much the same way.\\n\\nhow old is the universe?\\naccording to data released by the planck team in 2013, the universe is 13.8 billion years old, give or take a hundred million years or so. planck determined the age after mapping tiny temperature fluctuations in the cmb.\\n\\n\"patterns over huge patches of sky tell us about what was happening on the tiniest of scales in the moments just after our universe was born,\" said charles lawrence, the u.s. project scientist for planck, in a statement.\\n\\nwill the universe end? if so, how?\\nwhether or not the universe will come to an end depends on its density â€” how spread out the matter within it might be. scientists have calculated a \"critical density\" for the universe. if its true density is greater than their calculations, eventually the expansion of the universe will slow and then, ultimately, reverse until it collapses. however, if the density is less than the critical density, the universe will continue to expand forever. [more: how the universe will end]\\n\\nwhich came first, the chickenâ€¦er, the galaxy or the stars?\\nthe post-big bang universe was composed predominantly of hydrogen, with a little bit of helium thrown in for good measure. gravity caused the hydrogen to collapse inward, forming structures. however, astronomers are uncertain whether the first massive blobs formed individual stars that later fell together via gravity, or the mass came together in galaxy-sized clumps that later formed stars.\\n\\nfor thousands of years, humans have been looking up at the sky and wondering about their place in the universe. in the search for answers, we have undertaken many ventures and even created our personal gods. this book might not answer how big the universe is, but it will reveal how small we are.\\nthe boundary of the universe is that there is no boundary; the limit is that there is no finite limit to what we can learn and explore. infinity ends nowhere, and the universe becomes more comprehensive the deeper we look into it. our understanding of the universe has gone through a continuous state of variation since the time of aristotle. from our research and scientific advancements, we understand that human knowledge about the universe is restricted to our own endeavours. cosmology might have given us a rough idea regarding our place in the universe, but it displays a clear picture of our usefulness in the universe.\\nall of us are nothing but miniscule observers. we have just started our journey, trying to understand the complex language of the universe. the future of this universe was written around 13.8 billion years ago when something exploded and directed the creation of everything. today we know a lot more things about the universe; we have done more research in outer space then what we have undertaken in the deep seas. we do not know what lies at the bottom of earthâ€™s oceans, but we do have a rough picture describing the beauty of the universe. over the last century, none of us have expected the universe to be so vast,\\niv\\ngigantic, beautiful, and mysterious. today we can see a universe which is at least 93 billion light-years across in diameter.\\nmodern humans first walked on earth about 200,000 years ago. 200,000 is a minimal period. if we were to draw a cosmic time scale, our entire history would be nothing but a tiny dot. when we opened our eyes and looked up, the universe had already gone through most of its transitions, and we would never be able to see or understand a few of them. does the universe have a purpose? what is the origin of intelligence? are we alone? what is the meaning of human consciousness? what is the fate of our universe? such questions remind us that when it comes to the universe, the most straightforward questions are often the most complex ones. we are still on the hunt for solutions that could describe our questions, let alone finding their answers.\\nthere is a long list of cosmic lovers who devoted their entire life trying to unlock the mysteries of the universe. sir isaac newton helped shape our very first clear picture of the universe. with his discovery of gravitation, we were able to understand the physical interactions taking place around us, such as the workings of our solar system and why the moon does not fall to the earth. however, a lot of unanswered questions remained. that is where our role model, albert einstein came in. einstein successfully polished our view with his theory of relativity, and even a century later, we continue to use his work.\\ncosmology is the oldest branch of all known natural sciences. it is not just the study of planets, stars, galaxies and the cosmic background, it is an effort that could finally lead us towards the origin. for me and many others, cosmology is not a study\\nv\\nat all; it is a lift to the human aspirations and willingness to know more about ourselves. the study of the deep universe is the study of our universeâ€™s past. aliens (if any) living 65 million light-years away looking at earth would see dinosaurs ruling the planet. to understand the outer universe, we created the hubble space telescope, james webb telescope, etc., whereas to understand the inner universe, we created giant machines like the large hadron collider (lhc). todayâ€™s advancements in physics, biology, math, and other areas aim to provide us a quality life and prepare us for what will prove to be humanityâ€™s most significant battle, i.e., preserving the very spark of life in this universe.\\nsince the beginning, we have had a great interest in the night sky, and with the invention of the telescope, our willingness acquired wings because now we were able to look deeper into the heavens beyond the dark. the earliest telescopes were the refracting telescopes that originated in 1608 in the netherlands. telescopes have rapidly revolutionized our knowledge of the universe, which in turn has changed human history drastically. the big bang explosion was the beginning of fundamental pillars that will support life after billions of years. life grew in the lap of the universe; today, we are sure about the presence of life on at least one planet, i.e., earth. however, in the coming future, we can hope to uncover life at many more planets, not in the form of a little green man with big eyes and a small mouth but in terms of the type of civilization similar to ours.\\nthis book provides an extensive description of the wonders of the cosmos in a simple language. you will learn about the beauty of endless darkness and the questions that have arisen from our own answers. we will go back in time when the\\nvi\\nuniverse was also a small baby. we will explore the beauty of the early and present universe and also the future it may have.\\nin simple words, the beauty of the universe is hidden in our thoughts. human history is full of wonders because we created the meaning(s) to our existence. we have created heavens for ourselves, but we have also created hell. our journey is not consistent. it is our destiny to give sensible meaning to our lives and leave behind a better world for our descendants. that is something that inspired me to write this book, and kept me motivated during the long, painful journey.\\n\\nthe big bang happened 13.8 billion years ago.\\nformation of early

explosion occurred, space and time came into existence. so, when we ask ourselves â€˜what existed before the big bang?â€™, we are asking the wrong question because there was no time before the big bang. the terms before and after are bound by the strict laws of time. time itself was t=0 at the instance of explosion and started counting as the explosion occurred. so, we must be more precise and vigilant when we ask ourselves these questions.our human brain is designed in a way that makes it hard for us to imagine what existed before the big bang. we have become very used to 3-dimensional space and time that our collective intelligence cannot comprehend anything beyond that. mathematics can help us make four-dimensional andabove structures, but it is almost impossible for a human brain\\nto grasp it. maybe we are all wrong; maybe the god said, let\\nthere be light, and there was light. only time can answer these\\nquestions.\\nhawking-hartle model\\nthe hawking-hartle model was named after james hartle\\nand stephen hawkingâ€™s explanations of the early universe.\\nhawking-hartle model shows that it is possible to create a\\nmodel of the universe in which questioning what happened\\nbefore the big bang is the same as asking â€œwhere is the north\\nof the north pole?â€\\nthis model comes with the mathematical beauty, where time\\ncan be stopped. once you go before the big bang, time does\\nnot exist, and the universe we know becomes pointless in the\\nabsence of time. the absence of time before the big bang shows\\nthat time is one of the properties of the universe. however,\\nthere is a lot we need to learn about its original nature. our\\nunderstanding of time is limited to the way we measure it using\\nour clocks. the universe itself is bound to follow the strict laws\\nof time. since the universe has a finite age of 13.8 billion years,\\nwe can only see finite distances and vice versa.\\nthe big bang model describes how our universe came into\\nexistence, but it could not describe the region of space beyond\\nour horizon. it could not describe the last dark, the darkness\\nbeyond our observable universe. in our understanding, there\\nare three possibilities of what could be beyond our observable\\nuniverse.\\n\\n1. the first possibility is that space-time is different out\\n4\\nbaby universe\\nthere. the laws of mathematics that we know in this\\nuniverse do not work there. the darkness beyond our\\nobservable universe has its own set of rules. it would be\\nexciting to see if this is true, because all of our current\\nlaws come from the understanding of this universe.\\n2. the second possibility is that our own 3-dimensional\\nspace is currently expanding into a much bigger fabric of\\nspace-time. this idea comes from the understanding of\\nthe expanding nature of the universe, and if the universe\\nis expanding (which it is), then it must be expanding\\ninto something bigger. if that is not the case, and space\\nis creating more and more of itself every second, making\\nus feel like we are going through expansion would put to\\nrest all those questions.\\n3. the next possibility is that if we want to see what lies\\nbeyond our observable universe, we might have to open\\nnew dimensions. this universe is limited to three physical\\ndimensions and one dimension of time. we might have\\nto step out of these limited dimensions and see ourselves\\nfrom higher dimensions. that way we would be able to\\nsee if we are expanding into something bigger, or if the\\nspace is just creating more of itself.\\ntoday we have different theories answering the same question.\\nscientists speak differently in their own language about the\\norigin of the universe. when it comes to religion, it speaks a\\ndifferent language that blows my mind. most of cosmology\\naddresses what happened after the creation of the universe, and\\nonly a few of them explain the origin, like big bang theory.\\ntoday the most accepted and influential theory explaining the\\n5\\nbefore big bang\\norigin of the universe is big bang theory. if you have a theory\\ndescribing the origin of the universe, it must fit hundreds of\\nobservations and theoretical explanations, and only this theory\\nhas been able to do it so far.\\nbefore we talk about the big bang theory and the origin of\\nthe universe, we must talk about some of the early rivals of the\\nbig bang theory. these theories not only challenge the big\\nbang theory, but also provide us with a different perspective of\\nthe universe. even though there are a large number of theories\\nexplaining the origin of the universe, we will only look at three\\nof them.\\nsteady state theory\\none of the early rivals of the big bang theory, steady-state\\ntheory was first put forward by sir james jeans in the 1920s\\nand further revised in 1948 by hermann bondi, thomas gold,\\nand fred hoyle. this theory points out that the universe looks\\nthe same no matter where your point of observation is. all the\\ndifferent laws of physics and the variations occurring at the\\ndifferent places are likely to be the same. this theory produces\\na map of the universe, which is infinite, with no beginning or\\nend, and does not change with time.\\nsteady-state theory talks about the continuous creation of\\nmatter throughout the universe where there was no beginning,\\nand there will be no probable fate of the universe. the reason\\nwhy the universe goes through a continuous expansion is that\\nit continuously creates new matter by itself. however, since the\\nuniverse is expanding, its overall density remains the same.\\nthis theory gave an initial picture to the expanding universe\\n6\\nbaby universe\\nby pointing out that matter is being created proportionate to\\nthe expansion. as a result, the overall density always remains\\nthe same, which is quite different from the observations. this\\ntheory was popular in the 1950s, but today, it is not accepted\\nby most scientists as what we have found since then is entirely\\ndifferent from predictions made by this work. evidence found\\nsince the mid of 1960 indicates that this theory is incorrect,\\nand our universe is predicted to have a finite age.\\nthis theory also has no explanation for the cosmic microwave\\nbackground radiations, which maps out the entire cosmos. as\\nwe look deeper into the universe, it shows that the universe is\\nnot the same as it was a few billion years ago, which is quite\\nthe opposite of the arguments made in steady state theory.\\nfurther evolution in cosmology and the discovery of cosmic\\nmicrowave radiation ultimately ruled out the steady-state\\nmodels.\\n7\\nbefore big bang\\neternal inflation theory\\neternal inflation is a hypothetical inflationary model of the\\nuniverse. it is more like an extension of what the big bang\\ntheory states. eternal inflation theory says that after the big\\nbang, the universe went through a rapid expansion for a brief\\nperiod called inflation. this theory points out that this inflation\\ndid not stop and that it never will. this inflation will go for an\\ninfinite period of time. we can observe this inflation in the\\nform of the expanding universe. this expansion is governed\\nby the forces of dark energy, which we will discuss about later.\\nthis theory also talks about the possibilities of multiple universes\\nby predicting that new universes are coming into existence in a\\ncomplex model called the multiverse. our universe is just one\\nof the infinite number of universes. those different universes\\ncould have different physical laws and different properties,\\ndifferent from our known universe. the laws of science that we\\nknow in this universe might fail completely in those universes.\\noscillating universe theory\\nlet us suppose you have a spring in your hand, and when\\nyou stretch and release it, it oscillates. once you release it, it\\ncontracts, reaching a minimum amount of tension, and then\\nexpands, which builds more tension and the process continues\\nfor some time. this is what the oscillating model of the universe\\nstates.\\naccording to this theory, our universe is going through an\\nendless series of big bangs followed by big crunches that\\nrestarts the same cycle once again. this theory supports the\\nidea of big bang and its occurrence, but it also points out a\\n8\\nbaby universe\\nflaw in the big bang model, which is that it does not allow\\nan endless series of universes. we will study more about big\\ncrunch and other fate of our universe in the coming lessons.\\nsteady-state theory is a theory of the mid-1900s that has been\\nruled out by our current understanding of science. even though\\neternal inflation theory and oscillating universe theory still\\nhold their position among scientists, neither of these theories\\nare as successful as the big bang theory. only big bang could\\nsuccessfully explain the new discoveries made in the universe.\\nlet us have an inside view of big bang.\\n\\nthe big bang\\nthe story of the universe is our own story because we are the universe. all of us are tiny portions of the universe expressing ourselves at a much smaller scale. let us go back in time 13.8 billion years ago and understand its origin with the help of the most accepted theory, â€˜the big bang theory.â€™\\nabout 13.8 billion years ago, everything that was going to lead us into a future was lying somewhere in a tiny bundle of energy. this bundle of energy is smaller than an atom and infinitely dense. this bundle of energy is named as a point of singularity. the energy this singularity contains is enough to give birth to an entire universe. all the energy it is going to give to the upcoming universe (our universe) is lying in the same point. history is about to be written because this point of infinite energy is not stable at all.\\nwhen this singularity acquired enough extent of randomness, the big bang explosion occurred. it was the biggest of the biggest explosions that anyone has ever witnessed in history. this explosion occurred in a tiny fraction of time. with the occurrence of the big bang, our universeâ€™s journey had just begun, a journey which is going to lead to you, me, and humanity someday. just after the big bang explosion, the birth of time and space had occurred altogether. it is considered that not just space but time itself did not exist before this explosion.\\n10\\nbaby universe\\ntime had begun with t=0, and relativity supports the same\\nidea. dimensions used to have no meaning, and space was\\nnothing before this explosion.\\nwithin a fraction of a second, big bang created all the energy\\nthat has ever existed throughout the cosmos. all the energy\\nthat will power the stars, the energy that will fuel the galaxies\\nto give birth to new stars. all the energy that we are and will\\never consume and all the energy that will work as a powerhouse\\nfor the universe over the next billions of years was created in\\njust a tiny fraction of a second. the greatest thing about this\\nenergy is that it can be converted from one form to another,\\nbut its purity does not change. if we break matter and convert\\nit into energy, its purity will be the same as it was 13.8 billion\\nyears ago.\\nto run your car, you are using the same energy that was created\\nduring the big bang; you are using the energy of the universe\\nitself. your car is made up of different materials; different\\nmaterials that originate from a different form of the same\\nenergy released after the bang. a car is just one of the many\\n11\\nthe big bang\\nexamples of how humanity has recycled that condensed matter\\ninto different forms.\\nin the language of the universe, we are all bundles of the same\\ncondensed form of energy, which is what makes us all so unique\\nand special. the difference between us and any other piece of\\nother matter is not just the difference in composition. instead,\\nthe difference is the intelligence and the consciousness that we\\nhave acquired in a long process that took billions of years. a\\nrock does not contain the intelligence of exploring itself and\\nthe consciousness of knowing the world around itself. all of us\\nare, in reality, billions of years old as we are made up of a tiny\\nportion of the matter that was created after the big bang or a\\ntiny portion of the energy released in the big bang. the energy\\ncreated by this explosion moves into the known universe with\\nthe speed of light.\\ngetting back to the big bang, this explosion was so powerful\\nthat in a short period of time, our universe acquired a size from\\nsmaller than an atom to bigger than a galaxy. even at that size,\\nthis newly born universe was much denser than what we see\\ntoday. as quickly as the universe expanded, the faster it cooled\\ndown, today we see the temperature reach ~2.7 k. when the\\nidea of the big bang first came, no one took it seriously for\\na long time. however, hubbleâ€™s discovery of the expanding\\nuniverse turned it into a serious possibility. expansion of the\\nuniverse also tells us that if the universe is expanding today, it\\nwas smaller and denser in the past.\\njust one second after the big bang, the ingredients required\\nto make up an atom were created. in its very early age, the\\nuniverse was millions of times hotter than the core of our sun;\\n12\\nbaby universe\\nit was too hot for those elementary particles to bind up and\\nform atoms. the universe was not the same as it is today, it was\\ndenser, hotter, and was quickly filled with a uniform glow of\\nhot fog of hydrogen plasma.\\nonly the building blocks of an atom can exist at such\\ntemperatures; the higher temperature did not allow them to\\ncombine and form matter. if they do so, they would be ripped\\napart spontaneously. the combination of those elementary\\nparticles is the same as putting an ice cube in a furnace and\\nhoping to make a cold beer in the evening. as we know, ice will\\nbe melted away first into water, then into vapours, and finally\\ninto superheated steams.\\nas time passed, the universe got colder with its expansion;\\nthe primary ingredients came together and formed electrons,\\nprotons, and neutrons. with further expansion and cooling\\ndown of the universe, these particles combined, forming the\\nvery first atoms.\\nwhy did it bang?\\nwe do not know yet, we may have some strong evidence that\\nthe big bang explosion happened, but we are not sure as to why\\nit occurred. a question like what caused the instability in the\\nsingularity, which resulted in the explosion, is still unanswered.\\ntoday we have lots of ideas explaining what caused the big\\nbang from the singularity, but there is no way of knowing what\\nstarted this process in the first place. the only way of knowing\\nseems impossible, which is to go back in time 13.8 billion years\\nago and observe the singularity. even if we could travel back in\\ntime, we would never be able to observe the singularity itself\\nbecause time and space did not exist back then.\\n13\\nthe big bang\\nmultiverse theory talks about it to some extent but provides no\\npractical evidence. the theory says that there is an infinite sea of\\npure energy foam, which creates the universes like an inflating\\nsoap bubble, each with its own different laws. some universes\\ndie at the very instant they are formed while others are stable\\nlike ours. science does not pretend to know everything, so we\\ncan hope to discover the real cause of the big bang in the\\nfuture.\\nfoundations of the big bang model\\nbig bang is the most accepted scenario for the birth of the\\nuniverse. it is an effort to explain the birth of the universe. the\\nbig bang model of the entire universe rests on two critical\\ntheoretical pillars.\\n1. general theory of relativity by albert einstein\\nin 1916, when einstein developed the general theory of\\nrelativity, he proposed it as a new theory of gravity. he put\\nforward a very different picture of the universe. newtonâ€™s\\ngravity is valid only for the bodies that are either in rest or\\nmoving very slowly, and his assumptions restrict us from fully\\nstretching our legs. the central concept of general relativity is\\nthat gravity must not be described as a gravitational field, but\\nrather it is the distortion of space and time itself. physicist john\\nwheeler said, â€˜matter tells space how to curve, and space tells\\nmatter how to move.â€™ general relativity successfully explained\\nthe bending of light around the planets and the orbit of various\\nplanets that were unexplained.\\nalbert einstein said that matter can be converted into pure\\nenergy, giving his most famous equation e=mc^2. this theory\\n14\\nbaby universe\\nalso states that energy can also be converted into mass. after\\nthe big bang explosion, a large sum of pure energy was released.\\nthe same energy later turned into matter as the universe cooled\\ndown. this relation between relativity and big bang backs the\\nbig bang model of the universe.\\n2. the cosmological principle\\nafter the introduction of general relativity, application of\\nnew gravitational dynamics to the universe was a difficult task.\\nthe distribution of the matter in the universe is a big headache\\nbecause it seems to appear the same in every direction,\\nindicating that the distribution is homogeneous. this is called\\nthe cosmological principle. this assumption is being tested, as\\nwe can observe the distribution of galaxies on larger scales. in\\naddition, the cosmic microwave background radiation which\\ngave the footprint of big bang, showing a temperature which\\nwas highly uniform throughout the entire universe. which, in\\nturn, tells us about the uniform distribution of gases after the\\nbig bang explosion.\\nevidence of the big bang model:\\n1. hubbleâ€™s law: hubbleâ€™s law comes from the observation that\\ndistant galaxies are moving away from us. the rate at which\\nthey are moving away is directly proportional to their distance\\nfrom us. when an object moves away from us, its wavelength\\nappears longer, and the light is shifted towards the red end\\nof the spectrum. we call this phenomenon redshift. we have\\nobserved this redshift in the spectra of distant galaxies, coming\\nto the conclusion that they are moving away. as predicted by\\nthe big bang model, the universe has gone through a rapid\\nexpansion after the explosion. hubbleâ€™s law strongly supports\\n15\\nthe big bang\\nthe big bang model.\\n2. abundance of lighter elements: big bang model states\\nthat after the formation of the universe the lighter elements\\ncame into existence first as they were easy to form. most of the\\nordinary matter in the universe is made up of lighter elements\\nsuch as hydrogen and helium. the majority of elements in\\nalmost all the stars, including our sun, are hydrogen and\\nhelium.\\n3. cmb: cosmic microwave background is the electromagnetic\\nradiation left over from the early stages of the universe. this\\nradiation gives us a blueprint of the early universe and tells us\\nhow the radiations were dispersed through the entire universe\\nafter big bang.\\nno theory is perfect. almost every theory which tells about the\\nbeginning of the universe has its own flaws. big bang model\\nof the universe is no different, and it also has some significant\\nflaws, such as:\\n1. the big bang model states that the universe came from a\\nsingularity, a point of infinite mass and density. singularity\\nand infinite energy densities, which are the foundations of this\\ntheory, are mathematical concepts only.\\n2. the singularity that exploded was once completely stable. big\\nbang theory fails to describe what happened within singularity\\nwhich made it unstable. physicists are still trying to understand\\nwhat the possible reason could be. if the singularity of big\\nbang can become unstable and explode, then why doesnâ€™t the\\nsingularity of black holes also become unstable and explode\\nin a similar manner.\\n16\\nbaby universe\\n3. as we know, the universe is going through an expansion.\\nsoon after the big bang, the rate of expansion was very rapid.\\nthe big bang model fails to explain what changed the rate of\\nexpansion of the universe.\\n4. even though the big bang model gives a good picture of\\nwhat happened after the big bang. it fails to explain what\\nwas there before the singularity. it could not explain how the\\nuniverse looked like before the explosion.\\ncosmic microwave background\\nit is essential to study the cosmic microwave background\\nbecause it confirms the big bang model of our universe. cmb\\nis one of the fundamental pillars on which the big bang theory\\nis based. apart from other rival theories, cosmic microwave\\nbackground (cmb) also strongly supports the big bang model.\\ncmb is the mapping of thermal radiations or the afterglow\\nradiations scattered over the entire universe after the big bang\\nexplosion. it is also called as cosmic microwave background\\nradiation (cmbr). in general, the study of cmb is the study\\nof residual radiations left just after the big bang that are still\\ncirculating in the universe.\\nthe cmb was leftover when the universe was around 380,000\\nyears old. it is one of the most significant discoveries we\\nhave made in the era of space exploration to enhance our\\nunderstanding of the universe. as we know, rapidly expanding\\ngas cools down. it is thought that the continuous expansion\\nof the universe resulted in a lower temperature; it became low\\nenough to form atoms instead of breaking them apart.\\nthat is something that led the transition from a foggy universe\\n17\\nthe big bang\\nto a transparent one. cmb gave a perfect picture of the universe\\nwhen the temperature dropped enough to allow electrons\\nand protons to form hydrogen atoms. when these elements\\ncombined in the form of hydrogen atoms, photons and other\\nradiations were emitted. today we refer to them as cmb. this\\nera, when the universe took its early shape, is popularly known\\nas the recombination era.\\nthe cmb radiations are the earliest radiations that we could\\ndetect with the help of our instruments. no matter which\\ndirection we point our telescope, cmb radiations can be\\ndetected everywhere. which also gives us a rough picture of the\\nearly universe. we cannot measure or see these background\\nradiations with the naked eye because of our limited vision.\\nthe discovery of cmb is considered as a landmark test of\\nthe big bang model. in the late 1940s, alpher and herman\\npredicted cmb; it took another 15 years for penzias and\\nwilson to prove the existence of these background radiations.\\nthey stated that if the big bang theory is correct, there must\\nbe the background radiation leftover from the recombination\\nperiod that we are unable to find. when we figured out the\\ncmb radiations, it boosted the picture of the big bang theory.\\nthat is the moment when the early rival to big bang theory,\\ni.e., the steady state theory, put down all its weapons as it\\ncould not explain the cmb. in 1964, cmb was put forward\\nby these american radio astronomers. they earned the 1978\\nnobel prize for this ground-breaking discovery.\\nin short, cmb is the residual heat of creation itself that dates\\nback to about 13.8 billion years. we measured the current\\naverage temperature of the universe to be about 2.725 k, which\\n18\\nbaby universe\\nis the temperature of cmb. however, in the beginning, this\\ntemperature was trillions of degrees. on earth, we search for\\nthe fossils to explain how earth might have looked like millions\\nof years ago, while in space, we search for these radiations with\\nthe same aim. cmb helps us to understand the shape, size, and\\ngeometry of the universe.\\nthe spots on the map correspond to the photon energies\\nreleased in the recombination period. high energy areas\\nare blue while the low energy areas are red, similar to how\\nthe hottest region of a burning candle is the blue region. in\\ncontrast, the coldest and least energetic part is red. amazingly,\\nit has been found that the red spots (cold regions) are denser\\nthan the blue ones.\\nas it takes a long time for the photons to become free from\\nthe sunâ€™s gravitational shackles, in a similar way, more gas\\nclouds and space dust was crushed, which would not allow the\\nradiation to reach us while the blue part is the less dense region.\\nfor the coldest temperature, the density is maximum and vice\\nversa. when the cmb graph was plotted for the milky way\\ngalaxy, it gave a long red line along its centre.\\nsource: nasa\\n19\\nspace and time\\nspace and time used to be two very different concepts in newtonian physics. newtonian mechanics state that the distance of a star from two observers could be different, but time will always be the same. einstein said that there is no such thing as individual/personal time with the same value in all the frames. it variates with the frame of the observer. to define these active players, i.e., space and time, he used the word â€˜space-time.â€™\\nin a clear night sky, we see the moon, the twinkling stars several light-years away. for me, in my childhood, asteroids getting into the earthâ€™s environment used to be the broken stars moving here and there. space is a place holding all these things, and time is equally governing them in a direction. in simple words, space allows things to exist, whereas time allows things to happen. you can move in space and then return to your initial position, but it does not work with time.\\nwhat is space-time?\\nmathematically we represent the space in the form of a three-dimensional coordinate system over the plane of the paper. generally, we call them the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. if you are sitting in a room, you can observe them by taking a corner as the origin and the three corresponding planes as the three axes. time is not something different, but if you are looking for its\\n20\\nbaby universe\\nphysical measurements like matter, there arenâ€™t any. generally,\\nspace is defined based on a 3-d system where objects are\\nrelative w.r.t each other. combining the above four dimensions,\\nwe get the space-time, which constitutes the entire universe.\\nin simple words, space is a place. space does not change its\\nproperties while expanding. there is just more and more of\\nit and this formation goes on continuously everywhere, even\\nthough we do not feel this expansion in our daily life. if there is\\nspace, more is forming each second. one theory suggests that\\nthe universe itself is dark energy; it generates itself everywhere\\nas it is. another theory says the universe consists of particles\\nthat form and destroy each other. the energy of these particles\\nis dark energy enabling a space around us.\\ntake two points and fill the gap between them; it is 1-d space.\\nsimilarly, four distinct lines (a square) results in the 2-d space\\nthat will look like a plain sheet of paper. six squares put together\\nmaking a cube is 3-d and so on. 1-d, 2-d, and 3-d are as\\ndifferent as a line, a painting, and a sculpture. adding up the\\ndimension means adding up the freedoms. all the freedoms\\nin 2-d space are available in 3-d but not vice-versa. in short,\\nboth space and time are the mental constructs designed to\\ntake mathematical shortcuts to describe the beauty and the\\nbehaviour of the universe!\\narrow of time\\nearlier space was the only term used to specify the dynamic\\nuniverse. as our understanding evolved, one more term called\\ntime was added. now the universe was static in space and time,\\nand both galileo and newton agreed to that. later, relativity\\nplayed a central role in providing a picture of a relativistic\\n21\\nspace and time\\nuniverse. when we observed the nature of the universe, we\\nfound that there must be a parameter that can define the value\\nof time. we discovered the basic unit of time as â€œsecondâ€ (in\\ns.i.). today one second is well known as the time taken for\\n9192631770 (~9 billion) oscillations of cesium-133 atoms.\\ntaking all this information into account, the motion of all\\n1-d, 2-d, and 3-d objects can be measured.\\ntime is something that leads us towards the very next\\nmoment after every present moment; on that basis, we can\\ndistinguish between past and future and also experience the\\npresent. in terms of events, time is something indefinite, an\\ninfinite continuous process of similar events occurring in an\\nirreversible pattern, leading us from past to present towards\\nthe future. if you are sitting on a photon, you will experience\\na near-zero time interval between the instant it started from\\nthe surface of the sun to when it reached earth, the time lag is\\nzero in your frame, but we measure it to be 8 min and 20 secs\\nfrom our frame.\\nthe events once occurred means they will never return. once an\\negg is broken, it is broken; once a system has acquired entropy,\\nthe entropy will only increase (the past is always fixed). the\\nonly evidence that time flows and is flowing forward is that\\nit feels like it is. various physicists believe that â€˜timeâ€™ is only\\na human construct. today we have created clocks to measure\\nthis fundamental quantity accurately. earlier time used to be\\nmeasured by marking the position and movements of the sun\\nin the sky. this process is the same, stand straight under the\\nlight of the sun and observe your own shadow, if the shadow\\nis formed over your foot, it means half of the day has passed,\\nand it is noon. after the discovery of clocks, it was no longer\\n22\\nbaby universe\\nmeasured as it used to be. also, this technique fails during\\nmost winters, and when the sun is hidden behind the clouds.\\nthe concept of â€˜arrow of timeâ€™ was first given by arthur\\neddington in 1927. he predicted the one-way direction\\nof time. according to eddington, the one-way direction of\\ntime can be determined by studying the constituents (atoms,\\nmolecules, etc.) of matter. time appears to have a direction\\nin which the past stays behind, the future stays ahead, and\\nthe present stays with us, this is the arrow of time. we have\\nvarious basic parameters which clearly defines the timeâ€™s arrow\\nin their manner; some of them are:\\n1. firstly, we have the thermodynamic arrow of time. it\\nrests over the second law of thermodynamics. it defines\\nthe direction of time as one in which entropy increases in an\\nisolated system. the change in entropy can be taken as the\\nprimary parameter to distinguish the past and the future. since\\nthe beginning of the universe, entropy has been continuously\\nincreasing. based upon the increase in entropy, we can judge\\nthe age of the universe.\\n2. another parameter we have is the psychological arrow\\nof time. as described earlier, it is somewhere related to our\\nconsciousness and mental constructs. psychological arrow of\\ntime is how we perceive time in our daily lives. it allows us to\\nknow the past, but not the future.\\n3. the next we have is the universal/cosmological arrow of\\ntime. it defines the direction to be one in which the universe\\nis going through the process of continuous expansion. it is\\nthought that the arrow of time is headed towards the expansion\\nof the universe. some scientists predict that after a specific\\n23\\nspace and time\\ninterval of time, the arrow of time will reverse its direction\\nand when it happens, the expansion will also reverse itself. the\\nuniverse will end as a singularity.\\nwhat if there is no time?\\nevery present moment we are getting into the next moment\\nthat we call the future. that is how we generally experience\\ntime. the absence of time would be like the absence of fuel in\\nyour car because it cannot move without it. in the absence of\\ntime, everything in the universe along with the universe itself\\nwill get stuck within a single moment. we will get stuck in our\\npresent moment, but we will not realize it, much like the flow\\nof the river, causing the boats to sail will make them get stuck\\nat a single place. in the absence of time, we will not be able to\\ndifferentiate between the past, present, and future.\\nour intelligence, which allows us to understand the universe by\\nobserving the present after every past moment with the help of\\nmemory, will become worthless. however, the 3-dimensional\\nshape of the universe would remain the same. suppose you\\nhave created a universe having intelligent species like us. you\\nopt to stop the flow of time for an hour and upon restarting\\nit again, the species in the universe will not even realize that\\nthey were stuck within a single moment for the last hour. this\\nsimple thought experiment raises the question if that is already\\nhappening within this universe. if our universe delays with\\ntime; we may or will never know.\\n\\nuniversal forces\\nphysicists revolutionized human history in terms of what forces they have discovered. history gives us total evidence that whenever physicists discovered a new force, human history has changed drastically. science has made more advancements in the last 50 years than any other period in our scientific journey. there are various ground-breaking theories and well-known scientists who revolutionized the world. in just the last 20 years, we have done things that could not even be imagined in the last century.\\nsince the discovery of gravity by sir isaac newton and electromagnetism by michael faraday, it was believed that there are only two fundamental forces of nature. in the 21st century, we are aware of two more fundamental forces called nuclear forces, i.e., the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. this makes up a total of four fundamental forces of nature so far. all these forces lie at different ranges, with different properties, but one thing common among them is that they all originate by the same matter that we are made up of. every force acts differently under different circumstances but has a common root, i.e., matter.\\nunification of universal forces\\ntoday physicists are trying to unify all these four fundamental forces of nature. what unification of forces means is that\\n25\\nuniversal forces\\nthere must be a single equation and a single concept that\\ncould express all these forcesâ€™ beauty without any exception.\\nearlier, faraday and maxwell showed us that electricity and\\nmagnetism are the two aspects of the same thing, and they\\nnamed it electromagnetism. by the unification of electricity\\nand magnetism, we got a better understanding of their\\neffects and applications to the physical world. if we know the\\nfundamentals, unification could be the next step in getting\\nsome valuable physical outputs.\\norigin of fundamental forces?\\nanswer to the origin of all the fundamental forces lies within\\nthe first three minutes of big bang. if we could go back and\\nsee the era of the combination of the universe, we might\\nget our answers quickly. fundamental forces are not just\\na property. they are derived by some means. to understand\\nthe fundamentals of fundamental forces, we must turn to the\\nmicroscopic level and try to understand the initial picture of\\nour universe.\\ngravitation\\ngravitation is the weakest force of nature, having an infinite\\nrange. suppose you and your friend are standing at the opposite\\ncorners of the universe, both of you would still be attracting\\neach other with the gravitational force, but its strength would\\nbe near to zero. one of the primary and essential qualities of\\ngravitation is that it is always attractive.\\nwhile thinking about gravity, you might ask yourself what the\\ncause of this force is. well, isaac newton and albert einstein\\ndescribed this force in their own language. isaac newton said\\n26\\nbaby universe\\nthat objects experience gravity because they have mass. later,\\nalbert einstein made considerable contributions in this matter,\\ngiving a better understanding of this force through relativity.\\nthe idea that the mass of bigger planets distorts the fabric of\\nspace-time and gravitation is just the result of this distortion\\nchanged our understanding forever.\\nit is also thought that matter has some undiscovered elementary\\nparticles called gravitons. gravitons act as the gravitational\\nforce carriers and are the reason for the existence of this force.\\nhowever, this idea is not widely accepted because gravitons are\\nyet to be discovered.\\ngravitational force not only pushes us towards the surface of\\nthe earth but also helps to bind the solar system together. it is\\nthe force that is holding all the galaxies together for billions of\\nyears. since gravity has insufficient strength, the dark energy\\noverpowers this force, resulting in the universeâ€™s expansion.\\nevery particle in the universe experiences this force, and every\\nbody attracts every other body with this force. as newton said,\\nthe force between two bodies is proportional to their mass\\nand inversely proportional to the square of the actual distance\\nbetween them.\\n27\\nuniversal forces\\nelectromagnetism\\nelectromagnetic force has lightened up our entire world since\\nits discovery. when humans discovered electromagnetism, the\\nera of electronic appliances and wonders exploded. all the\\nelectronic gadgets that we have in our home, such as laptops,\\npersonal computers, lights, t.v., etc. are nothing but byproducts\\nof this force. the electric and computer revolution\\nwould be impossible without the discovery of this force.\\nelectromagnetism is not just one single force. it is a force of\\nelectricity and magnetism working together. it is the second\\nstrongest natural force with an infinite range. the electrostatic\\nforce is a force acting between two electric charges at rest,\\nwhereas the force acting between two magnetic poles is called\\nthe magnetic force. the electrostatic forces and magnetic forces\\nare closely related to each other. in simple words, electrostatic\\nand magnetic forces are inseparable and considered the two\\ndifferent faces of one general force known as electromagnetic\\nforce.\\nwith the discovery of strong and weak nuclear forces, our\\nlearning about the matter enhanced very rapidly. we have\\ndiscovered these two new forces in the last century. with\\nthe discovery of these forces, our grasp upon the atoms got\\nstronger and we can now utilize nuclear power, the power of\\natoms. we can use the energy of matter itself. atomic bombs,\\nnuclear weapons, nuclear reactors are the by-product of these\\ntwo forces. both forces are very short in their range.\\n28\\nbaby universe\\nstrong nuclear force\\nstrong nuclear force holds the nuclei together; it holds the\\natoms together. in simple words, a strong nuclear force is\\nresponsible for holding all the ordinary matter in the universe.\\nthe strong nuclear force is the most potent force of nature,\\nbut it is also the shortest in range. strong forces are carried by\\nthe particles called gluons. whenever there is an interaction\\nbetween two particles with strong force, they are exchanging\\ngluons between them. it is the gluons that bind protons and\\nneutrons together inside the nucleus of an atom.\\nit is impossible to detect this force directly as it works on a\\ntiny scale. to detect a strong nuclear force, we need an atom\\nsmasher. as an atom smasher smashes the particles together,\\nit breaks them apart into their constituents. once a particle is\\nbroken, we can study the trail it left behind and understand\\nwhat it is made of.\\n29\\nuniversal forces\\nweak nuclear force\\nthe weak nuclear force appears only between the elementary\\nparticles involved in a nuclear decay process such as betadecay\\nof a nucleus. in beta-decay, a beta particle (an energetic\\npositron or electron) is emitted from an atomic nucleus. the\\nweak nuclear force is short in range with a much weaker\\nrelative strength that makes nuclear decay possible. this force\\nis not responsible for holding the nucleus together. the weak\\nnuclear force is instead responsible for the radioactive decay of\\natoms.\\nweak nuclear force plays an essential role in nuclear fission.\\none example of a radioactive decay is uranium. in the nuclear\\n30\\nbaby universe\\npower plants, uranium is used as a fuel to produce electricity.\\ninside the nuclear power plants specifically, neutrons collide\\nwith the uranium atoms, splitting them. this fission of the\\nuranium atoms releases a lot of energy that heats water. this\\nhot water produces steam, and the pressurized steam is then\\nused to spin turbines. the turbines are connected to generators\\nwhich produce electricity.\\n31\\nstory of light\\nthe best way to eliminate any kind of fear is to understand the reality of the situation. during my childhood, i was afraid of going into dark places. from an evolutionary point of view, it is natural for us humans to be afraid of the dark, but science helped me understand that darkness is nothing but the absence of photons. i am no longer afraid of darkness.\\nbefore we discuss the story of how the speed of light was calculated, we need to understand what light is. light is a form of energy or electromagnetic radiation carried by photons that can move around in space at a very high speed. visible light is a small portion of the spectrum of light that enables us to see objects in their various colours depending upon their unique wavelength. the wavelength of visible light varies from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).\\nwe have a star as our primary source of energy and light that we call as the sun. the presence of light has transformed our universe into an observable one. in the absence of light, we would not be able to do most of our space-related experiments, and most of our gadgets, including telescopes, will become useless. our understanding of the nature and speed of light has also gone through a continuous state of variations. during the 17th and 18th century most of the scientists used to believe\\n32\\nbaby universe\\nthat light has an infinite speed, whereas some believed that it\\nmust be limited, and speed of light was a significant part of the\\ndiscussion among scientists.\\nnewton predicted that the speed of light could be changed,\\nand it is variable concerning the frame of reference. which\\nmeans if you had a torch and you were running in the direction\\nof an object with a velocity â€˜v.â€™ the speed of light for that would\\nbe c+v and vice versa. however, the man of the century, albert\\neinstein, strongly predicted that the speed of light is invariant\\nand independent of the frame of different observers. c+v and\\nc-v were the wrong assumption. it is always c no matter what\\nframe you are in. an object cannot outpace the speed of light\\neven if you continue to apply force. any frame moving with\\nspeed faster than light will sound the same as a cat dying before\\nitâ€™s birth; you going through all the pages of this book before\\neven opening it. as soon as a frame reaches the speed of light,\\nit contracts down to zero length.\\nactual speed of light\\nprior to the late 17th century, it was thought that the speed of\\nlight is either infinite or cannot be measured with the help of\\ncurrent instruments. in 1676, astronomer olaus roemer was\\nthe first person who did some of the first measurements of\\nthe speed of light, observing the motion of io, one of jupiterâ€™s\\nmoons. during his observation, he found that i0 is not at the\\nposition where it should be.\\nroemer thought if the speed of light is infinite, then the\\npositions of jupiterâ€™s moons must conform to what he predicted\\nwith 100% accuracy, but this was not the case. this idea made\\nhim conclude that the speed of light is not infinite, and it takes\\n33\\nstory of light\\nsome time to reach us from any object. he tested the same idea\\nby measuring the time interval of eclipses when jupiter was\\nclose to and far away from earth. by knowing the predicted\\nposition, the actual position and the distance of io from earth,\\nroemer calculated that the speed of light is 214,000 km/sec.\\nit is a little closer to what we have calculated today. after\\nroemer, many scientists came forward and calculated the\\ndifferent speeds of light by their own different methods.\\nin 1726, james bradley measured it to be 301,000 km/sec by\\nusing the method of stellar aberration. to understand stellar\\naberration, let us use the example of falling rain. suppose you\\nare standing still in the rain with no winds, the droplets will\\nfall vertically and hit directly on your head. however, if you\\nstart running, the rain will hit you on the front at a specific\\nangle, depending upon your running speed.\\nas we know, earth is revolving around the sun, so the position\\nof distant stars must change slightly due to its yearly motion.\\nknowing the speed of earth around the sun, bradley measured\\nthis angle for starlight and found the value for the speed of\\nlight to be 301,000 km/s.\\n34\\nbaby universe\\nin 1849, armand fizeau measured it to be 315,000 km/sec by\\nusing the method of the toothed wheel. fizeau used a beam\\nsplitter and focused the beam of light onto a plane where a\\nspinning toothed wheel was located. light passing through\\nthe toothed wheel was projected to a mirror located 5 miles\\naway. the endpoint beam of light was then reflected back to\\nthe point of origin. fizeau then kept increasing the rotating\\nwheelâ€™s speed until the returning light from 5 miles away was\\nentirely blocked by the tooth of the wheel. knowing the speed\\nof the wheel and the distance light has travelled back and forth,\\nfizeau measured the speed of light to be 315,000 km/sec.\\n35\\nstory of light\\nin 1862, leon foucault measured it to be 298,000 â±500 km/\\nsec, by using the method of rotating mirror. leon foucault\\nmade one of the most accurate measurements for the speed\\nof light in his time. his experiment consists of two mirrors,\\none fixed mirror while the other one was rotating. the basic\\ntechnique here is to send a sharp beam of light on a path so\\nthat it bounces between a rotating mirror, a fixed mirror, and\\nright back to the rotating mirror for a total distance of 2d,\\nas shown in the illustration. as light travels the 2d distance\\nand comes back, the rotating mirror will have turned very\\nslightly in angle. this small rotation in the mirror deflected the\\nbeam of light through a small angle î¸ from its original path,\\nproducing a measurable effect. using this idea, foucault was\\nable to calculate the speed of light to 298,000 â±500 km/sec,\\nwhich is very close to what we know today\\n36\\nbaby universe\\nin 1879 and 1926, albert michelson measured it to be approx.\\n299,910 â±50 km/sec and 299,796 â±4 km/sec, by using the\\nabove method of rotating mirror.\\nin 1958, k.d. froome measured it to be 299,792.5 â±0.1 km/\\nsec, using the radio interferometer method. interferometry\\ncan also be used to measure the wavelength of electromagnetic\\nradiation, which can be very useful when trying to determine\\nthe speed of light. at that time, laser technology was not\\ninvented, so other coherent radio sources of light were used by\\nfroome to measure the speed of light.\\nin 1973, evanson et al measured it to be 299,792.4574\\nâ±0.001 km/sec by using lasers. it was the most accurate value\\nto be calculated because lasers are highly monochromatic and\\nunidirectional.\\nfinally, in year 1983, the speed of light was accepted by the\\n37\\nstory of light\\ncommunity of scientists around the world to be 299,792.458\\nkm/sec. roughly we use it as 3ã—10^8 m/sec in our mathematical\\ncalculations. the real credit for calculating the speed of\\nlight goes to olaus roemer, who could measure its roughly\\napproximate value by observing the motion of planets even\\nwhen the distance between planets was not accurately known.\\nwhat is a light-year?\\na light-year is misunderstood as a unit of time. instead, it is\\na unit of distance. one light-year is the distance travelled by\\na beam of light in 1 year, which is equal to 5.8 trillion miles\\nor 9.4 trillion kilometres. the diameter of our milky way\\ngalaxy is about 100,000 light-years. which means, if light\\nstarts travelling from one end of the milky way, it would take\\n100,000 years to reach the other end.\\n38\\ntime-travel\\nis it possible to travel in time? the most straightforward answer is that â€˜we are all time travelers.â€™ even when you are going through these lines, you are traveling in time. because that is something taking you into the next moment after every moment of the past. the only difference is that the universe itself governs this time machine, and the universe has its own laws and parameters to govern it. we consider time to be the fourth and last dimension of the universe. we do not get stuck in the past moment. equally, we do not stick in the present moment, and with the passage of every moment we are heading towards the future moments. that is the arrow of time, from present to future.\\nif we are all time travellers, then what is time-travel?\\ntime travel is the most perplexing riddle of the universe because it is about traveling at a rate faster or slower in time. whenever we talk about time travel, the very first picture that comes to mind is that there would be a complex machine, you will step into it, and it will send you into the past or future depending upon the red or green button you have pressed. this is what we all have seen in comics and marvel movies, but reality speaks a very different language.\\ntraveling into the future by time dilation is a well-known phenomenon as described by special and general relativity.\\n39\\ntime-travel\\nrelativity says that it is possible to travel in time using space\\nitself. the twin paradox allows us to travel forward in time\\nby using a very fast-moving spaceship. but when it comes to\\ntraveling backward in time, the grandfather paradox gives rise\\nto a large number of unsolved questions.\\ngrandfather paradox\\nlet us begin with a small story, suppose max is a time traveller.\\nhe travels back in time to the 1950s when his grandfather was\\na handsome young man. he steps into his grandpaâ€™s home and\\nfinds that it is the day when his grandfather is going to meet his\\ngrandmother for the very first time. max meets his grandfather\\nand somehow stops him from meeting his grandmother. this\\nway, his grandfather will not be able to meet his grandmother,\\nwhich means maxâ€™s father will never be born in the future, and\\nthus, there will be no max. in this paradox, max prevented the\\nbirth of his father and consequently his own. however, this\\nis untrue when it comes to reality, for max is already present\\nin the future. how can two opposite events occur at the same\\ntime? does that mean we cannot travel back in time?\\none of the best examples of why backwards time travel is not\\npossible is that we do not have any humans from the future.\\nif it were humanly possible to travel back in time, then why\\nwould the future humans not want to come and share all of\\ntheir technological secrets to make things easy for us. but\\nthe counterargument of this argument is that maybe we are\\nthe future humans. maybe, we are on the front seat of the\\ncosmological timescale.\\none theory suggests that even if we could travel back in time,\\nwe will not be able to influence the future. the future from\\n40\\nbaby universe\\nwhere you travelled back in time will go on its path without\\nany influence of time travel. physicists explain time and\\ntraveling back in time using the example of a river. time is like\\na river flowing in one direction, and we are sitting in a boat in\\nthat river. this way, all of us are experiencing the same time.\\nnow suppose someone jumps out of the boat and tries to swim\\nbackward, they will not be able to do so.\\nhowever, let us suppose they do swim backward, in that case,\\nwhat they will do is that they will create a separate timeline. in\\nthat timeline, if max meets his grandfather and prevents the\\nbirth of his father, not only will he never be born, but also in\\nthat timeline, no one will ever know that a max is living in a\\nsimilar but different timeline.\\nsome scientists also suggest that it is impossible to create a\\nseparate timeline, and if we somehow travel back in time, we\\nwill not be able to influence it at all. this means that max will\\nnot be able to stop the meeting of his grandfather with his\\ngrandmother. this idea raises questions against the nature of\\nthe grandfather paradox. equally, what is even more important\\nis that why should we travel back if we will not be able to\\ninteract with it or make any influence!\\nthere is one more idea that revolves around the grandfather\\nparadox. whenever max goes back in time and modifies his\\npast, he is creating a new universe. this way, he stopped the\\nmeeting of his grandparents in a universe where he is unknown.\\nbackward time travel is not just difficult but also very\\nconfusing, but forward time travel is not that confusing. there\\nare different ways we can travel forward in time. some of the\\npossible explanations for forward time travel are:\\n41\\ntime-travel\\n1. high velocity: this idea comes from the twin paradox\\nof relativity. suppose there are twin brothers sam and leo,\\nboth aged 22. one day leo decides to enter a very high-speed\\nspaceship, whereas sam stays back on the earth. leoâ€™s spaceship\\nis very advanced, and can glide over the fabric of space-time\\nand reach a speed close to light. leo enters the spaceship\\nand programs it to travel towards proxima centauri, located\\naround 4.2 light-years away from earth. leoâ€™s spaceship starts\\nfrom earth, reaches a very high speed and after a few years,\\nit reaches proxima centauri. on reaching proxima centauri,\\nleo decides to travel back to earth. after a few more years,\\nleo returns to earth. currently, leo is in his 30s as he was in\\na spaceship for several years. however, when he returns back\\nto the earth, he finds that his brother, who was 22 when he\\nleft, has become too old and not able to walk without external\\nsupport.\\nusing this paradox, einstein tried to explain that once you reach\\n42\\nbaby universe\\na very high-velocity, time slows down for you as compared to\\nsomeone in a stationary frame of reference. this significant\\ndifference in velocity between two frames makes time travel\\npossible. as we get closer to the speed of light, distances get\\ncontracted and time slows down; that is the beauty of relativity.\\nthere is one main problem with using high velocity as our\\nmeans to travel in time. we do not have the technology, let\\nalone a spaceship that can travel to a speed close to the speed of\\nlight. our fastest spaceships today can reach only a fraction of\\nthe speed of light. the way we have developed our technology\\nin the last 50 years, we can hope to develop a fast-enough\\nspaceship in the coming 1000 years, so all the hope is not lost.\\nuntil then, we can only wait and think about more effective\\nways to travel in time like, for instance, using a black hole.\\n2. using black holes: the idea of using black holes to travel\\nforward in time comes from our understanding that time\\nslows down when you are near an object with a very high\\ngravitational potential. and what in the universe has a higher\\ngravitational potential than black holes?\\nin this case as well, we can use the example of sam and leo, but\\nlet me keep things as short as possible. the main idea here is\\nthat if we take a very advanced spaceship and revolve around a\\nblack hole, time will run slower for us compared to the person\\non earth. do not get confused when i say that time will run\\nslower. time running slower does not mean things will happen\\nin slow-motion for us in the spaceship. instead, our feeling\\nof time will remain unchanged, but what will happen is that\\nafter we revolve around a massive black hole several times for\\none month and return to earth, several months would have\\n43\\ntime-travel\\nalready passed on earth. our feeling of time and the way we\\nexperience it will remain unchanged, and we might not even\\nnotice that we have travelled in time.\\nthere are two main problems with using a black hole as our\\ntime machine:\\n1. the first problem is that they are mighty and have a\\npowerful gravitational potential. most of the black holes\\nhold an ability to suck a complete star system, and so our\\nspaceship must be fast and powerful enough to escape\\nout of its potential. just being fast enough will not work\\nnear a black hole, our spaceship should also be strong\\nenough to stand against the gravity of black hole.\\n2. the next problem is the humans in that spaceship. we\\nhave all grown up on earth, experiencing a specific\\ngravitational potential on earth. if you try to stand on\\nthe surface of a neutron star, you will get crushed almost\\nimmediately to the level of an atom. we have already\\nseen the example of the human body acting differently\\nin different gravitational fields. the astronauts who go\\nto the iss (international space station) and spend a\\nfew months in zero gravity, get stretched. their height\\nincreases by a few centimetres, and they experience this\\neffect themselves. that is because living here on earth,\\nwe are continuously pushed towards this planet. when\\nour spaceship gets very close to a black hole and starts\\norbiting around it, how would that impact our astronauts?\\nwould they be able to stay alive while being in such high\\ngravitational potential?\\nboth of the above scenarios seem to be impossible to overcome\\n44\\nbaby universe\\nnot just today but in the coming decades as well. when it is\\nabout black holes, our nearest black hole is a062000 (v616\\nmon) and is located roughly 2800 light-years away, making it\\ndifficult to reach there. only time will tell how we defy its own\\nrules and travel forward or backward in it.\\ntime travel is a part of science fiction today; earlier in 1895,\\ntime travel gained its popularity because of the novel â€œthe\\ntime machine,â€ written by h.g. wells. theories like special\\nand general relativity provide us the geometry for spacetime\\nand also make time travel possible, as explained in the\\ntwin paradox. stephen hawking suggests that the absence\\nof tourists from the future is an argument against backward\\ntime travel, but it does not mean that backward time travel\\nis impossible. it could be possible that we are living with the\\ntourists from the future, but they do not consider themselves\\nto be from the future.\\nfor some physicists, time travel is a human construct, and we\\nare playing with the property of space itself, especially when\\nwe are moving forward in time. time may flow in a definite\\ndirection, we may travel forward in time, but traveling back\\nseems impossible. it is like a game, once you have taken a\\nforward step, the doors behind closes.\\nit seems to be impossible today, but we must not forget that\\nthe future comes with hope. time travel is not impossible, but\\nthat does not mean it is possible either. time dilation has been\\nscientifically proven correct in measurements of atomic clocks.\\none of the daily life examples of this paradox is the î¼-mesons,\\nwhich are unstable cosmic rays formed 10km above earth.\\ntheir lifetime is about 2ã—10-6sec, and velocity is about 0.998c.\\n45\\ntime-travel\\nthe î¼-mesons should travel a distance of about 600 meters\\nbefore their disintegration, but here comes relativity. because\\nof time dilation, their lifetime increases slightly, and they can\\nbe found over earth.\\n46\\nmultiverse\\nearlier it was thought that earth is the centre of the universe. this is not surprising at all because when we look up at the night sky, all the stars appear to be moving around earth. it was the natural assumption for the people 600 years ago with limited knowledge guided by their religious books.\\nit was also believed that we are the only living creatures in the universe, and that there is zero possibility for life on any other planet. this is still the case because we have not found alien life yet, but we have found hundreds of planets orbiting in the habitable/goldilocks zone of their respective star system. it is also possible that life could be in a very different form or even be primarily made up of compounds other than carbon. with time we have become more open-minded to new ideas, which include that earth is not the centre of the universe, and there could be planets with alien life. today when we look upward, we found ourselves to be a small part of our medium-sized milky way galaxy in an endless cosmos.\\nas per the discoveries made in the early 19th century, our universe was supposed to be the only one. everything that we know and have ever discovered was supposed to be confined within the boundaries of a single universe. but today we have theories describing the possibilities of multiple universes, i.e.,\\n47\\nmultiverse\\na multiverse. the name â€˜multiverseâ€™ explains itself as â€˜multiple\\nuniverses.â€™ the multiverse is an idea supported by mathematics.\\nthere is a multiverse, a series of multiple universes where our\\nuniverse is just one of the finite/infinite number of universes.\\nsome theories make it possible for multiple universes to\\nexist, such as string theory. it says that there could be other\\nuniverses out there, and we can move out to other universes.\\nwhen two universes collide, they fuse into each other forming\\na much bigger universe. in contrast, when a single universe\\nsplits, it creates two independent universes that have their own\\nlaws and properties. multiverse seems to be strange because\\nthe universe seems to be only one place for us, i.e., our universe,\\nwhereas multiverse deals with multiple dimensions. multiverse\\ntheories also state that there could be a universe where there\\nis an exact copy of you and a universe where you do not exist,\\ngiving a solution to the grandfather paradox.\\n48\\nbaby universe\\nthe idea of multiverse only lies within our books, there are\\nno practical shreds of evidence that we have found. we do\\nnot know how to check the originality of this theory with the\\npresent technology. we only know selected things about our\\nown universe in the first place, multiple numbers of universes\\ncome later. we suggested that everything has come from a\\npoint- a singularity. the idea of singularity proved to be real,\\nas in the case of black holes. in the same way, we are looking\\nto check the originality of this idea. some physicists believe\\nthat multiverse is just a vague term having nothing to do with\\nreality.\\nif our universe is one of many universes, where did the multiple\\nuniverses come from?\\nit is predicted that our universe is a part of a much larger\\npicture; we are nothing but a drop in the ocean. we do not\\nknow the easy answer to this question because we have no\\nways to go out there and find out for ourselves. some scientists\\nbelieve that multiple universes originate from a larger ocean of\\nenergy foam. birth and death of a universe in energy foam is\\nlike bubbles coming in and out of existence in a bathtub. few\\nof those bubbles break almost instantly, whereas the others\\nhold for some time. the idea of our universe is in an energy\\nfoam where universes are being born and destroyed seems\\nfascinating. but it takes us back to the very first piece of the\\nsame puzzle. if our universe is a part of a much larger ocean,\\nthen where is the ocean at? inside an even bigger entity? who\\nknows?\\nwe might not know about the presence of other universes, but\\nwe do know about the presence of one universe, i.e., our own\\n49\\nmultiverse\\nuniverse. others are yet to be discovered. now you might ask,\\nif there are multiple universes, how can we leave this universe\\nand enter a new one? well, this is where wormholes come into\\nplay. we can create wormholes to travel long distances not only\\nwithin one universe but also between universes.\\nwormholes\\nas explained by albert einstein through general relativity,\\nwormholes are also known as the einstein rosen bridge.\\nto understand the working of wormholes, we will use a\\nstraightforward concept. take a sheet of paper in your hand\\nand select two points a and b at the different edges of that\\npage. if you want to travel from point a to point b, you can\\ntake as many routes as you want, but the shortest one would\\nbe a straight line. suppose the distance between point a and\\nb is around 15 cm and starting from point a you travel at\\nthe speed of 1 cm per second, it would take you 15 seconds to\\nreach point b. now take the same piece of paper and fold it so\\nthat points a and b are sitting at the top of each other. now\\nthe distance between a and b would become almost zero, and\\nyou can travel from a to b in no time.\\nalpha centauri is located around 4.3 light-years away.\\npractically, if we started traveling from earth in a spaceship, we\\nwould never reach there in one lifetime. also, our astronauts\\nwill not survive long in a spaceship under cosmic rays and\\nthe lack of survival stuff. so, to travel from earth to alpha\\ncentauri, we can use the concept of wormholes. we can create\\na wormhole whose one end is in our solar system, and the other\\nend opens near the star alpha centauri. this way, we can travel\\nsuch vast distances within a fraction of time.\\n50\\nbaby universe\\nwormholes are the pathways/tunnels within one or more\\nuniverses. a wormhole is created by gravity by bending spacetime\\nuntil it pinches and comes out to another side. they are\\nalso considered as tunnels to travel long distances in a short\\ntime. creating a wormhole would require energy and tools\\nthat we do not possess today. some physicists suggest that\\nwormholes can exist naturally in the universe, and if we look\\nhard enough with the right tools at the right places, we may\\neven find one. that way, instead of creating a new wormhole,\\nwe can use an already existing one.\\nwith our theoretical understanding of wormholes, it is not\\nclear if we can pass through a wormhole without splitting into\\nsmall pieces and eventually turning into a pure form of energy.\\nhow would a wormhole react when a piece of matter (in this\\ncase, us) is passing through it. we need a better understanding\\nof such topics.\\n51\\nmultiverse\\nhow to create a wormhole?\\nphysicists suggest that to create or open a wormhole, we\\nneed something called negative energy. the negative energy\\nis required to hold the wormhole open for long enough so\\nthat matter could pass through it and reach the other end. if\\nwe could not do so, the matter would converge, and we might\\nnever come out of the other end. we should not relate negative\\nenergy with antimatter because antimatter has positive mass.\\nwe all have seen the interstellar movies where they use\\nwormholes to travel vast distances quickly. an enormous\\namount of energy can be used to wrap space in a way that\\nwill result in a wormhole. today, we are way behind such\\nengineering. the present technology is unable to create energy/\\nnegative energy at the large extent required for these pathways.\\nwhat is the difference between a black hole and a wormhole?\\nblack holes are more like a suction device, they take in\\nanything and everything that comes in their path. their gravity\\nis so strong that nothing can escape. black holes are caused by\\nmassive amounts of matter that collapse because of their own\\ngravity and end up as a singularity. wormholes are shortcuts\\nbetween two distinct parts of the universe, instead of ending\\nup at a singularity, wormholes end up at some other part of\\nthe universe. today, we have proof for the existence of black\\nholes, whereas wormholeâ€™s existence is yet to be verified.\\nwormholes are a hypothetical and theoretical construct. today\\nwe do not have any sharp shreds of evidence suggesting the\\npresence of wormholes. however, mathematics allows them to\\nexist, allowing pathways to exist that can be used as shortcuts\\n52\\nbaby universe\\nfor long journeys. the reason why physicists think that they\\nshould exist is because they do not violate the laws of physics.\\nwormholes are one of the theoretical solutions to the relativity\\nequations. we have not observed them yet, but that does not\\nmean they do not exist.\\nin simple words, there are no laws that prevent their existence.\\nwe listen to what mathematics says not just because it is the\\nexpression of numbers and characters in a transparent manner,\\nit is the language of the universe itself that can describe its\\nbeauty on a sheet of paper.\\nleaving the universe\\nâ€˜leaving the universeâ€™ is becoming a part of the science fiction\\nmovies where we see some of the most ludicrous ideas coming\\nto life. the very first question that comes to our mind is where\\nto go after leaving this universe? for as long as we have existed,\\nthere has been only one universe. we study it, we analyse it, and\\nwe live in it. today, we have theories describing the possibility\\nof the presence of multiple universes where our universe is\\njust one among them. if we can locate their presence, then we\\ncan use wormholes as a tunnel to travel in and out of those\\nuniverses.\\nwe have discussed various possible scenarios for the death of\\nour universe, any of which could be real. so, it is inevitable\\nthat if we do not leave this universe when the time comes,\\nintelligent life will die. we must leave the universe when it\\nbecomes unstable because of any of those possible scenarios.\\nwe might not be able to hinder the fate of the universe because\\nwe do not play a central role in it. so, leaving the universe is the\\nbest idea. firstly, we need to figure out the answer to several\\n53\\nmultiverse\\nquestions such as:\\n1. does the next universe support life, or does it already contain\\nsupernatural beings?\\n2. what would be the nature of the new universe? would it\\naccept matter from our universe entering it?\\n3. if the next universe is made up of antimatter, how would we\\ndeal with it?\\n4. would we ever be able to transform into a type-4 civilization\\nwhich has the ability to deal with multiple universes?\\nthe universe is full of immense possibilities, and what we have\\nseen and observed till now cannot be found in any book of the\\nearly 19th century. boundaries of the universe increase as we\\nlook deeper into it. every single day we continue to learn new\\nthings about the universe that no one knew before. we are\\ndoing things that no one thought was possible 100 years ago.\\nit will take a long journey for humanity to be able to leave the\\nuniverse. we must become the master of space and time to\\nbe able to leave our universe. as already discussed, a type-4\\ncivilization can create and use wormholes as tunnels connecting\\nthe different universes. however, right now we are a type-zero\\ncivilization, way behind achieving the goal. we have limited\\nabilities and are very much limited to a single planet. we are\\ndivided in so many ways that it may take even longer than\\nexpected to transform into the next type of civilization. all our\\nobservations have taken us towards the conclusion that we do\\nnot know the future, and we are nothing but small observers\\non a tiny planet and trying to figure out the meaning of what\\nis around us. today we are not in a position to say that we are\\n54\\nbaby universe\\nsure about the fate of the universe because we cannot even\\npredict the journey we will lead in the next 100 years.\\nall the above fates of the universe are not possible, only one\\nwould be. maybe it could be a combination of two, who knows.\\nmaybe the truth is lying in some other form; the universe never\\nstops surprising us. history gives the evidence that whenever\\nwe tapped hard about something, nature proved us wrong.\\nanother possibility is that we will not be here to see the fate\\nat all.\\nthe above fates described so far are based on the nature of dark\\nenergy and its role observed by us today. even its nature might\\nvary as the universe ages. what we know about the physics\\nof dark energy is that we do not know what it is. we are not\\nreally sure where it came from; only a very little is accurately\\nknown about dark energy. the origin of dark energy is also\\nlying somewhere in the first three minutes of the universe.\\nuniverse changes with time, and our predictions may acquire\\nstrong shapes or get debunked with time. it is possible that\\nthe known dark energy equation will change, resulting in a\\nvery different universe that will completely change our present\\nunderstanding. the description of dark matter and dark energy\\nremains obscure and hypothetical. the possibilities of their role\\nwithin the universe are currently unknown.\\nhow dark energy and dark matter will react with the coming\\nuniverse, how they will react with the universe they are creating\\nis a point of discussion for us today. all we know about them\\nare observational constraints in some theory papers. choosing\\none among these rival scenarios is difficult because all these\\nscenarios are supported by equal observations and are thrown\\n55\\nmultiverse\\nback by the same ideas. we can hope that future science will\\nallow us to choose one of these competitive scenarios.\\n56\\nbaby universe\\npa r t i i\\nafter the big bang\\n57\\nmatter\\nwe have already discussed how the big bang created the universe. we have discussed what space-time is and why it helps us in creating a primary picture of the universe. now we must understand the elements that came into existence after this explosion. the universe recombined in the form of billions of galaxies containing trillions of stars and planets, all of which came from dust clouds.\\nwhat was the by-product of the big bang and how did it dominate the early universe?\\nto know these answers, we must understand the baby picture of the universe and discuss the aftereffects of the big bang. earlier it was thought that our universe consists of matter only. the matter that we are made of makes up everything in the universe, and there is nothing in between. as a result, matter was the only point of discussion among scientists in the early 20th century. it helped us to a large extent because we were able to discover hundreds of subatomic particles and give birth to quantum mechanics. as a result, in the 20th century, most of the nobel prize winners in physics were the scientists who had discovered a new particle.\\nover time as we looked deeper into the space, our picture of the universe evolved. we found evidence that there is something else apart from ordinary matter that is affecting the working of\\n58\\nbaby universe\\nbillions of galaxies. there is something that we cannot directly\\nobserve playing a significant role in the way galaxies rotate and\\nhold themselves together. as we found evidence, our doubts\\ndecreased in number, and we knew that matter is not the only\\nthing in the universe. we named this new form of matter\\nas dark matter. a form of matter that we cannot see, but it\\ninteracts with us in the form of gravity.\\nour quest to know about the cause for the expanding universe\\nhas taken us beyond the milky way galaxy and towards the edges\\nof the expanding universe. as soon as we found out that the\\nuniverse is expanding, we realized that there must be a hidden\\nforce driving this expansion. this new driving force came in\\nthe form of dark energy. on further evaluation, we realized\\nthat this expansion is not constant mathematically; it varies\\nwith time, which means our universe is not only expanding it\\nis also accelerating.\\nthe presence of matter has introduced us to ourselves. it has\\nenabled us to say that yes, we do exist. something dark in the\\nspace that we cannot interact with got its name as dark matter.\\ndark energy is a way more complex subject of discussion. there\\nare many more things about the universe we do not know. our\\nentire understanding of the universe could be nothing but a\\ndrop in the ocean, and dark energy proves this point.\\nmatter truly matters!\\nin order to understand matter and its nature, let us do a simple\\nexperiment. let us reverse the process of evolution, reverse the\\nprocess of formation of matter and go back in time towards the\\nbig bang explosion. as we start going backward in time, first,\\nwe will become apes, then we will see the dinosaurs roaming\\n59\\nmatter\\naround planet earth. as we keep going back in time, we will\\nfind ourselves in the ocean in the form of aquatic life, which\\nhappened only 500 million years ago. if we go 4.54 billion\\nyears back, we will see the formation of our planet, but that is\\nnowhere close to the big bang.\\nas we quickly approach the big bang explosion, we will find\\nourselves in the form of early atoms which are falling apart. as\\nwe keep going towards the very first second of the universe,\\nour atoms will completely disintegrate into pure energy, and\\neventually, we will find ourselves in a tiny singularity. the same\\nsingularity where it all began. at that point, there will be no\\nspace for us, and time will stop, so we would not be able to go\\nfurther back in time.\\nthat is precisely what happened in the early universe. the early\\nuniverse was so heated that the constituents that make up\\nelectrons, protons and neutrons could not interact with each\\nother and form atoms. we can imagine the early universe as\\na super-hot soup, a soup with all the nutrients that your body\\nrequires, but you cannot drink it as it is too hot.\\nafter a short period after the big bang, the universe expanded\\nexponentially, but with this expansion, it also cooled down very\\nquickly. once the universe acquired a specific temperature,\\nquarks arranged themselves forming protons and neutrons.\\nwith the birth of protons and neutrons, we have the basic\\nstructure needed to make up atoms, i.e., the nucleus. protons\\nand neutrons came together, forming the very first nuclei, but\\nthat was not enough because we still needed electrons around\\nnuclei to complete our atoms.\\nas the universe kept expanding and cooling down, the\\n60\\nbaby universe\\nelectrons got trapped around the nuclei. however, this process\\ntook another 380,000 years. that is how the first atoms came\\ninto existence. our very first atoms were mainly the hydrogen\\natoms because they are small atoms making it easy for the\\nprotons and neutrons to combine and build the structure. this\\nfact can be observed in the universe even today. almost all\\nthe stars that we see in the night sky are mostly made up of\\nhydrogen. this proves that this simplest possible element was\\nproduced in abundance in the early universe.\\nafter the big bang explosion, our universe was like a cloud\\nof fog. it was filled with a uniform glow of white-hot fog of\\nhydrogen plasma. one other thing that happened with the\\nformation of the first atoms was that our universe became\\nmore and more transparent as we see it today. the study of the\\nearly universe shows that matter and energy were distributed\\neverywhere homogeneously. now we have a universe that\\nis not only expanding but also full of hydrogen atoms. it is\\nnatural to wonder how all the stuff that we see in the night sky\\ncame into existence.\\nthe first atoms formed in the universe are our true ancestors.\\nthose atoms are essential because the cores of massive stars\\nin the infant universe will use them to create the rest of the\\nmatter (including us). after the formation of the first atoms,\\nover the next millions of years, gravity did its magical work.\\ngravity combined the unevenly scattered atoms and formed\\nlarge gas clouds across the universe. as those gas clouds\\nbecame more prominent, they started having their collective\\ngravity and started attracting more matter. the smaller gas\\nclouds combined with bigger gas clouds, resulting in the\\nformation of massive gas clouds. from a distance, everything\\n61\\nmatter\\nlooked normal, but if we went at the centre of those gas clouds,\\nsomething else was happening. the first stars of our universe\\nwere being born at the very centre, or we can say in the womb,\\nof those gas clouds.\\ndue to the gravitational force of the massive gas clouds\\nthemselves, the hydrogen atoms were forced to come together\\nand form the very first shining stars. when the temperature at\\nthe core of those stars reached hundreds of million degrees, the\\nhydrogen atoms slammed together, creating heavy elements\\nsuch as helium and lithium. in this process of combining\\nhydrogen atoms, some energy was released, which gave shine\\nto our newly born stars. those early stars were massive, and our\\nuniverse was twinkling with their light. however, the bigger the\\nstar is, the more quickly it fuses the matter at its core, reducing\\nits overall lifespan. some of those stars exploded in the form\\nof supernova explosions and gave us heavy elements such as\\n62\\nbaby universe\\ncarbon, oxygen, iron, gold, etc. the carbon in your body\\nand the gold jewellery that you wear, all of it were formed at\\nthe core of massive stars billions of years ago. some of those\\nstars became black holes after the explosion and guided the\\nformation of early galaxies. that is a point of discussion for\\nanother chapter.\\nantimatter\\nnow we know the story of the matter that we can see, touch,\\nfeel, and observe and also how it came into existence. however,\\nthat is an incomplete story. there is another player in this game\\nthat tried to dominate the universe, i.e., antimatter. shortly\\nafter the big bang, our universe was filled with the neutrons,\\nprotons, electrons, and their antiparticles. these antiparticles\\ninclude anti-neutron, antiproton, and anti-electron (also\\nknown as positron). during the first three minutes of creation,\\nall these elementary particles were created.\\nantimatter is composed of antiparticles having the same mass\\nas ordinary matter but opposite charge. in the early universe,\\nantimatter particles came together, forming antimatter just\\nas ordinary matter did. for example, an anti-neutron and\\nantiproton can form an anti-hydrogen atom with a positron\\norbiting around it. it is believed that matter and antimatter\\nwere created in the same quantity in the early universe, so we\\ncan say that the early universe was full of hydrogen and antihydrogen\\natoms. however, there was a problem; matter and\\nantimatter are rivals of each other.\\n63\\nmatter\\nwhere is all the antimatter today?\\nif we talk about rivalries, matter and antimatter had the biggest\\nrivalry in the history of the entire universe. on meeting with\\neach other, these two annihilate each other leaving behind pure\\nenergy. just after the big bang, matter and antimatter particles\\ncame into existence and started their battle. this rivalry ended\\nwith the matter that we know today winning the raceâ€”this\\nrivalry leftover cosmic radiations behind as their fingerprint,\\nwhich we can observe.\\nif matter and antimatter had eradicated each other, then our\\nuniverse would be different today. it would be full of cosmic\\nradiations and nothing else. there would be no sign of galaxies,\\nstars, planets or even black holes. it would be nothing but a\\nmassive expanding void. this makes me wonder if multiverse\\ntheory is correct, then there must be a universe where there is\\nno matter and even a universe where antimatter had won the\\nrace.\\nin the beginning, if antimatter had won the race, our universe\\nwould be just as it is today but made up of opposite particles.\\n64\\nbaby universe\\nour stars would be made up of anti-hydrogen atoms, creating\\nanti-helium elements at their core. we would be wearing\\njewellery that is made up of anti-gold. at the same time, we\\nwould be curious to know what ordinary matter is as we are\\nabout antimatter here.\\nhow did matter defeated antimatter?\\nwe know from experience that most of the matter particles\\nare highly stable, and they can stay as they are for billions of\\nyears. however, a few exceptions such as uranium, thorium\\nand radium decay at a slow rate. it is still not clear how matter\\ndefeated antimatter, but one theory suggests that the antimatter\\nparticles are unstable. antimatter particles decay very quickly,\\nand the decay process begins at the same instant as they are\\nborn. even though matter and antimatter were formed in\\nan equal amount, the decay process resulted in an imbalance\\nbetween matter and antimatter. that imbalance helped matter\\nto win over antimatter.\\ntoday we know that our universe consists of 4.9% of ordinary\\nmatter, which is a small amount. this percentage would be\\nzero if antimatter were as stable as matter. at the same time,\\nwe would have 4.9% antimatter if matter was as unstable as\\nantimatter. just a little disproportion between matter and\\nantimatter became the reason for our existence in this universe.\\nwhatever we see in the night sky, whatever we have seen with\\nthe help of giant telescopes, consists of the same matter as us.\\nif you are still confused about matter, do not worry, just look at\\nyourself, for you are made up of the same type of matter.\\n65\\nmatter\\nhiggs boson\\nhiggs boson has a long history because it played a central role\\nduring the formation of our universe. if you are standing on\\nmoon, your weight is six times less than on earth, but your\\nmass remains the same. it does not matter what you weigh\\nat different places in the universe, but your mass will never\\nchange. here we are going to talk about what gives matter its\\nmass.\\nwhere mass comes from is a typical problem because mass\\nis somehow related to gravity. the current model of particle\\nphysics could not deal with gravity in the way it was supposed\\nto. big bang caused the formation of fundamental particles,\\nand they combined and formed matter, and matter produced\\ndifferent varieties of itself by massive explosions, but that still\\ndoes not explain what gives matter its mass.\\nhiggs boson was vital because it was the only missing piece, the\\nmissing elementary particle of the standard model of particle\\nphysics not discovered yet. after 50 years of speculation and\\nspending over 10 billion euros, physicists finally found the\\nhiggs boson. it was detected by colliding highly energetic\\nphoton beams at a velocity comparable to light in the large\\nhadron collider (lhc). the higgs boson is termed as the\\nmissing piece of the big bang, and a missing part of the big\\nbang theory. physicists believe that in the beginning, the\\nuniverse was a singularity. it can be explained as a crystal.\\nan unstable crystal whose geometry was distorted by the\\nhiggs boson particle. causing the impurity in the universeâ€™s\\nsingularity and making it explode.\\n66\\nbaby universe\\nin 1964, physicist peter higgs developed his theory to explain\\nwhat gives everything (matter) its mass. he suggested that\\nsomething must have been created during the first second that\\ngave particles their mass. he suggested that a universal force\\nfield swiped across the entire universe during the first second,\\ngiving particles their mass. today this field is well known as\\nhiggs field. when particles interact with higgs field, they\\ngain their mass. those particles that interacted more with this\\nfield gained more mass and vice versa. higgs field is carried by\\nits particle â€˜higgs boson,â€™ also known as the god particle. higgs\\nfield is a field lying everywhere in the universe where some\\nparticles can go through it, whereas some particles interact\\nwith it, slow down in the process, and translate into mass. on\\ndecember 10, 2013, peter higgs and francois englert were\\nawarded the nobel prizes in physics for their spectacular work\\nand contributions in the standard particle physics model.\\nwhat does the name god particle mean?\\nleon lederman was the first to introduce this name in his\\nbook â€˜the god particle: if the universe is the answer,\\nwhat is the question.â€™ lederman gave this name because\\nhe felt this particle to be crucial for a heavy understanding of\\nmatter. if lederman had titled the book something else, our\\nunderstanding today would have remained the same, but its\\nmeaning would have changed. at first he wanted to name it\\nas â€˜goddamn particle,â€™ but his editor did not allow him to do\\nso. the term â€˜god particleâ€™ has nothing to do with god, it is\\na particle just like the others. however, the primary picture\\nof higgs boson created in the brain of ordinary people does\\nnot clarify the reality. the name was a joke, no doubt, but\\nunluckily no-one laughed because it was taken too seriously\\n67\\nmatter\\nwith time. overall, we must be happy about it because it means\\nthat religious people are reading physics today, at least to know\\nabout the â€˜godâ€™ particle.\\nstring theory\\nin the 1950s, when we started smashing atoms, we got hundreds\\nof smaller hidden pieces of matter. no one had imagined that\\nthere could be 100s of hidden particles inside an atom. these\\ndifferent particles have different roles to play. until the discovery\\nof higgs boson, the model of particle physics was incomplete.\\nwith the discovery of higgs boson, particle physicists believed\\nto have discovered everything inside an atom. however, that is\\nwhere string theory comes into play. string theory says that\\nthere is one more fundamental piece of matter that is yet to be\\ndiscovered. the standard model of particle physics we know is\\nincomplete, according to this theory.\\nstring theory suggests that matter consists of small vibrating\\nstrings of energy. this theory has an explanation for dark matter\\nas well. string theory says that dark matter also consists of the\\nsame strings, but their vibration occurs at a different frequency\\nthan ordinary matter. as a result, we are not able to see dark\\nmatter or interact with it.\\nwhat is the basic idea of string theory?\\nstring theory has its own way of explaining what matter\\nconsists of. suppose you have a piece of matter in your hand,\\na potato, for example. put that potato under a microscope and\\nobserve very carefully. when you do so, you would be able to\\nsee the molecules that make up the entire potato. now take\\none molecule and put it under a mighty microscope. what\\n68\\nbaby universe\\nyou will find is that the molecule is made up of a large number\\nof small atoms. now take one atom and put it under an even\\nmore powerful microscope. this time what you will find that an\\natom is made up of even smaller elements; those are electrons,\\nprotons, and neutrons. we are not done yet. if you take these\\nparticles and put them under a very powerful microscope, you\\nwill find that these particles are made of even small particles\\nsuch as quarks, or you might even observe the higgs boson.\\nthis is where the string theory comes into play. string theory\\nsays that if you take these particles such as a quark and observe\\nit even more closely, you will find that it is made up of tiny\\nvibrating one-dimensional strings of energy. moreover, these\\nstrings are the fundamental ingredients that make up everything\\nin the universe. all the other elementary or subatomic particles\\nare made up of these tiny vibrating filaments, strings.\\n69\\nmatter\\nnow the question arises that as there are so many subatomic\\nparticles that we have discovered, how does string theory\\nexplain their presence? according to string theory, one type\\nof vibration of these strings makes up quarks, whereas the\\nother type of vibration of those strings makes up higgs boson\\nand so on. all the different types of particles are nothing but\\ndifferent types of vibrations of the same string. these different\\nvibrations of strings can be compared with the different nodes\\nof music.\\nnow you might ask yourself, how small are these strings?\\nas explained in this work, strings of the string theory are of\\nthe order of planck length, i.e., 10 to the power negative 35\\nmeters. this means if we want to see those vibrating strings, we\\nmust look at them deeper than the planck length. searching\\nfor a string inside matter would be like searching for a small\\nneedle in the atlantic ocean; that is how small they are. as per\\nthe standard physics model, smaller particles are considered\\nfundamental building blocks of matter. string theory gives\\nus a very different view of the matter. string theory not only\\nchallenges particle physics but also challenges our current\\nunderstanding of atomic and subatomic particles.\\nstring theory has provided us a different view to look into\\nmatter and gave us its fundamentals to describe the universe.\\nhowever, this work is not practically proven yet. we do not\\nhave the capacity to look that deep into matter and see the\\nvibrating strings. we can hope that one-day the large hadron\\ncollider will prove or disprove the accuracy of this theory.\\n70\\ndark matter\\nwe are aware of ordinary matter and how it came into existence. it is the time to talk about its dark side, i.e., dark matter. about 85% of the total matter in the universe is dark matter, whereas the remaining 15% is ordinary matter. dark energy makes a large portion of the universe; namely 68%, with 27% of dark matter, and less than 5% of ordinary matter.\\nduring the 1930s, when scientists studied distant galaxies and their motion, their calculations did not fit with the rotation of galaxies. based upon the amount of matter present in the distant galaxies and the speed at which they are rotating, they must fall apart eventually. the matter that they consist of does not have enough gravitational pull to hold those galaxies at that rotational speed. these findings revolutionized the scientific world and made them wonder as to what could be holding these galaxies together.\\nscientists made various calculations based upon the visible mass of galaxies. this indicated that there is an invisible mass in these galaxies whose gravitational pull is adding up with that of ordinary matter and holding the galaxies together. scientists were sure that there must be an invisible form of matter that we have been missing out on.\\nso, what is holding these galaxies together and affecting their\\n71\\ndark matter\\nmotion?\\nour answer came in the form of a missing piece of the\\nuniverse that we call dark matter. dark matter refers to the\\nexotic matter that interacts with ordinary matter in the form of\\ngravity. the gravitational pull of dark matter helps in holding\\nall these galaxies together and affects their motion. dark not\\nonly means that we cannot see this form of matter, it also\\nmeans that it does not emit any electromagnetic radiation that\\nwe can detect. we have no methods or tools of seeing it, which\\nmakes it hard to study and understand dark matter. it does not\\ninteract directly with light except for its gravitational effects,\\nwhich makes it invisible.\\ndark matter exerts a strong â€˜gravitational forceâ€™ like other\\nmatter, which means it attracts other matter towards it. in\\nour galaxy alone, there is so much dark matter that its force\\nis holding the entire galaxy together. discovering dark matter\\nwas not difficult, but understanding it is.\\nanother proof of the presence of dark matter came in the form\\nof gravitational lensing. when scientists studied the distant\\nimage of galaxies, they often found them stretched and oddly\\nshaped. since there was no visible source of matter affecting the\\nmotion of light between us and those galaxies, they concluded\\nthat there must be something invisible bending the light coming\\nfrom distant galaxies and affecting the trajectory of the light\\nbeam. further research showed that dark matter is not only\\nholding other galaxies together, it is also present everywhere in\\nthe universe, deflecting the path of light as it passes through\\nit. by detecting the deflection of light in a galaxy, we can see\\nthe presence of dark matter. through gravitational lensing, we\\ncan trace the presence of dark matter everywhere in our galaxy.\\n72\\nbaby universe\\ndistribution of dark matter, its amount, and its position\\nwas revealed and further confirmed by gravitational lensing.\\nordinary matter and dark matter bend light as it passes\\nthrough or near to them. as told by albert einstein, everything\\nin the universe is affected by gravity because everything in the\\nuniverse causes gravity. by observing a galaxy, we can map out\\nthe distribution of dark matter. by mapping out the galaxies,\\nour calculations gave the number 26.8 as the percentage of\\ndark matter. we cannot see dark matter directly, we can only\\nobserve its gravitational effects on our universe.\\nat first it was thought that dark matter is just a new type\\nparticle of ordinary matter that does not emit light, but\\nthis idea does not fit with any theory. dark matter is unlike\\nanything we have ever seen. dark matter is so powerful that\\nit has the power to influence the whole galaxy. it affects the\\nformation and spin rate of a galaxy; it cannot be just a missing\\npiece of ordinary matter. the presence of this invisible matter\\n73\\ndark matter\\nis everywhere; even if you are currently sitting in your room,\\nthere would be some dark matter passing through your body\\nright now. we cannot feel it since it does not interact directly\\nwith ordinary matter.\\nthe discovery of dark matter also came with various questions\\nsuch as what is it made up of? how do we figure it out?\\nscientists are hunting for dark matter all over the world;\\nsome are hunting for it thousands of feet underground. dark\\nmatter is passing through the earth billions of particles at a\\ntime but rarely collides with ordinary matter. scientists are\\nusing a small block of germanium, cooled down to a very,\\nvery low temperature. the idea is that while passing through\\nthe germanium atom, dark matter particles may interact with\\nits nucleus. because of this collision, the temperature of the\\ngermanium atom will be enhanced slightly. this increase in\\ntemperature can be measured by the sensors present over the\\ngermanium block. labs are designed underground because\\nthere could be other particles such as cosmic rays that will\\ninteract with the germanium atoms, hit the nucleus, and result\\nin wrong data. hence, to clear all the junk, experiments are\\ncarried out underground. unluckily dark matter is yet to be\\ndetected by any lab in the world.\\nby studying all the radiation left over from the big bang\\nexplosion, we can identify where more of the radiation exists.\\nmore radiation means more matter or even more dark matter.\\nthis way, scientists have identified dark matter across the\\nuniverse and created a universal map of where it might be\\nconcentrated most. here are some possibilities of what dark\\nmatter could be:\\n74\\nbaby universe\\n1. it is possible that dark matter could be an undiscovered\\nparticle, but it does not act like any particle we know so far.\\nwe know it is there because of its gravitational influence. if it\\nis a particle, one thing we know is that it can interact with us\\nin the form of gravity. what the nature of this particle is and\\nwhat it is made up of is a point of discussion. if it is made up\\nof a different kind of particle, that would open a new branch of\\nphysics for scientists to study.\\n2. another possibility is that our existing understanding of\\ngravity is incomplete. our current theories break down when\\nwe talk about the gravity of dark matter. everything we know\\nabout matter comes from the understanding of its gravitational\\neffects. einstein explained gravity as the curve in space-time\\nfabric. gravity of dark matter supports this idea. but theory\\nof relativity cannot explain what dark matter is. the only way\\nit interacts with ordinary matter is in the form of its gravity,\\nso once our understanding of gravity is complete, we might be\\nable to tell what dark matter is.\\n3. the next reason why dark matter does not directly interact\\nwith any particle could be that it is not from our 3-dimensional\\nworld. some scientists predict that dark matter could be a\\nforce field from a higher dimension whose gravity is somehow\\nleaking into our dimensions. if that is the case, it proves that\\ngravity can travel between multiple dimensions and connect us\\nwith other higher dimensions. this theory not only opens the\\npossibility of higher dimensions but also the presence of some\\nother force fields in them. if dark matter is a force field leaking\\nfrom the higher dimensions, then one day we might be able to\\ntrace its footprints to get to the higher dimensions.\\n75\\ndark energy\\nopposite of gravity, dark energy is the repulsive force causing the expansion of the universe. we know about the 5%of ordinary matter, we can see it, feel it and even touch it. next, we have the 27% of the dark side of matter, dark matter. we cannot directly interact with it, but we can observe its presence via various methods such as gravitational lensing. so, what is the rest of the 68% of our universe made of?\\nthe answer comes in the form of dark energyâ€”the energy of darkness or the energy of vacuum itself. the concept of dark energy was first revealed by albert einstein. however, at that time, the static model of the universe was more widely accepted by the scientific community. theoretically, einstein was able to determine that our universe must be expanding, but that idea did not fit well with the other known cosmological facts of that time. so, to give a static model of the universe (a universe that is not expanding), einstein dropped his idea of the expanding universe and added a new term to his equations, the cosmological constant.\\nin the late 1920s, a talented astronomer named edwin hubble was studying the deep universe. distant galaxies, stars and supernovas were his main points of interest. one thing he liked most were supernova explosions because, with their\\n76\\nbaby universe\\nhelp, he was trying to figure out if our universe is expanding.\\nafter some long observations and studying several supernovas,\\nedwin hubble concluded that our universe is not static at all,\\nand in fact, it is expanding. with this discovery, einstein felt\\nabsurd, and he had to drop the cosmological constant from\\nhis equations. this is known as one of the biggest blunders of\\nalbert einsteinâ€™s career.\\nwith the discovery of an expanding universe, another question\\narose: since the universe is expanding, how fast is it expanding?\\nat that time, the infinite attractive strength of the gravitational\\nforce was well known. it was obvious for scientists to predict\\nthat if our universe is expanding, then it must be slowing down.\\nthe gravitational force of all the objects in the universe must\\nbe working collectively to stop this expansion. which gave us\\nanother question: at what rate is our universe slowing down?\\nin the 1990s, astronomers once again turned their telescopes\\ntowards the exploding supernovae to determine the deceleration\\nrate of the universe. they were surprised to find that the\\nexpansion of the universe was not slowing down, instead, it\\nwas speeding up at an exponential rate. this discovery helped\\nastronomers conclude that there must be something in the\\nuniverse counteracting gravity, and scientists later named\\nit as dark energy. calculating the amount of energy needed\\nto overcome gravity and expand the universe exponentially,\\nscientists determined that dark energy makes up about 68\\npercent of the entire universe. it is a large portion of the\\nuniverse, slightly more 2/3rd, but we are not sure as to what\\ndark energy really is.\\nif you go back in 1900 and ask the scientists of that time as\\n77\\ndark energy\\nto what empty space means, some would say that they do\\nnot know, whereas most of them would say â€˜empty space\\nmeans nothing. there is nothing in-between us and all the\\nother distant stars and galaxies.â€™ to them, empty space is\\nthe definition of nothingness. however, today we know that\\nempty space means something, and it has much more power\\nthan the overall gravity of the universe. today we know that\\nempty space has energy, the energy of space itself. we call this\\nenergy as dark energy. space consists of this energy, which is\\ncausing a one-way expansion of the universe.\\nit is believed that just like ordinary matter and dark matter,\\ndark energy was also created just after the big bang explosion.\\nit was here since the very beginning, and we just have figured\\nit out recently. after the big bang, as the universe expanded\\nrapidly, dark energy took over the force of gravity. as millions\\nof years passed and new stars and galaxies formed, the strength\\nof dark energy also increased, creating more space between\\nthose stars and galaxies. the density of matter and dark matter\\nis very high. since we are all made up of 5% ordinary matter,\\nif you take one of your hands and put it on the other hand, it\\nwill rest and not pass through. but dark energy has a very low\\ndensity or maybe even no density at all. even with such little\\nto no density, dark energy can dominate over both matter and\\ndark matter.\\nthere is both a positive and negative side of dark energy being\\nable to dominate the universe. if dark energy were not as strong\\nas it is, then the gravitational force of ordinary matter and dark\\nmatter would have stopped the expansion of the universe long\\nago and would have reversed the process.\\n78\\nbaby universe\\nas a result, our universe might have contracted, ending up as a\\ngigantic ball of matter and energy. that would be a nightmare\\nfor all the species living on this planet, or we might not have\\nbeen able to see it happening because the universe might have\\ncontracted much before the formation of our solar system.\\nthanks to the repulsive nature of dark energy, we are living in\\na universe where galaxies and stars are not getting closer over\\ntime and smashing into each other.\\nthe repulsive nature of dark matter has prevented the grim\\nfate of the universe, but at the same time, it has opened a\\nnew possibility. let us try and understand this with a simple\\nthought experiment. imagine a classroom with 30 chairs\\nplaced near each other; right now, all the students can interact\\nwith each other and study as a group. however, the problem\\nwith this classroom is that its floor is expanding. the chairs are\\n79\\ndark energy\\nat their consecutive place, but the floor is expanding, increasing\\nthe distance between the students. what will happen after\\nsome time is that students would not be able to interact with\\neach other as they are getting apart from each other. that is\\nprecisely what is happening in the universe right now. all the\\ndistant stars and galaxies are moving away from us due to the\\nrepulsive nature of dark energy. our stars and galaxies are at\\nthe same place as they are, but the distance (or space) between\\nthen is increasing continuously. if dark energy continues to\\npush galaxies apart, there is no doubt that our universe will die\\ncold, and all intelligent life will freeze to death.\\nsome scientists believe that this expansion of the universe will\\nnot go on forever. at some point in time, maybe a billion years\\nfrom now, the force of gravity will overtake the repulsive force\\nof dark energy, and our universe will begin contracting. what\\nhappens when we contract is a point of discussion for another\\nchapter, but looking at the nature of dark energy, we are not\\nsure if that will ever happen.\\nfrom the history of our observations, we can say that the\\nuniverse is on a one-way expansion, and not slowing down.\\nthe rate at which other galaxies are moving apart from each\\nother is directly proportional to their distance from us. this\\nphenomenon can be observed in the form of redshift, which\\nmeans that light has shifted towards the red end of the\\nelectromagnetic spectrum. suppose you have an alien friend\\nnamed xeto living on an alien planet thousands of light-years\\naway. if you ask him to glow a green light towards our planet,\\nthen by the time that light reaches us, it would have become\\nred. however, this is not practically possible because the light\\nwill take thousands of years to reach, and you would be dead\\n80\\nbaby universe\\nby then.\\nwhenever we want to measure vast distances in the universe,\\nwe use this phenomenon. we observe how much light has\\nstretched and shifted towards the red end of the spectrum\\nwhile traveling through the expanding fabric of space. as a\\nscience enthusiast, you might have several questions about\\nthe existence of dark energy. so, i will leave you with three\\nconclusions of what it could be:\\n1. our first possible solution for dark energy is that the\\nuniverse is filled with a changing energy field, also known as\\nâ€œquintessence.â€\\n2. another possibility is that our current understanding\\nof gravity is incomplete. our current model of gravity only\\nincludes the gravity of matter and dark matter. the force of\\ndark energy could be another part of gravity, just opposite in\\nnature.\\n3. the leading theory, however, considers dark energy as a\\nproperty of space itself. it predicts that empty space can have\\nits own energy, and this indicates that as more space emerges,\\nmore energy is added to the universe, increasing its expansion.\\n\\nearly stars and galaxies\\nat the beginning of our universe, stars were formed when a large amount of dust and gases came together. it is not an easy process for stars to shine and show us their bright light. gravity plays a significant role in this process. the early stars started shining as soon as hydrogen started to fuse into helium due to the gravitational force of the star. the outside gravitational force of a star not only provides extra pressure for hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium and other heavy elements but also raises the inner core temperature of a star, which makes the process easier.\\nearly stars in our universe used to be very big compared to our sun because their formation took place in the early pure hydrogen clouds. due to gravitational forces, some of those stars kept on adding more and more matter and went on becoming denser and heavier. as they became big, they added more matter to their pile. some of those early giant stars ended up as a supernova explosion creating heavier elements. it is believed that most of the heavy elements such as iron and gold that we use today came from the explosion of those stars that formed soon after the big bang. not all stars exploded into a supernova, some of them contracted under their own gravity resulting in the formation of massive black holes.\\nso now we had a universe full of massive black holes and\\n82\\nbaby universe\\ngiant stars; most of which exploded and gave us heavier\\nelements floating everywhere. early universe was smaller\\nand much denser, so those early black holes started sucking\\nmore and more matter into themselves, forming a giant disk\\nof matter revolving around them. because of their enormous\\ngravitational attraction, all the matter in a long distance also\\nfound itself revolving around them.\\nbecause of the rotation of black holes, the diskâ€™s shape around\\nthem turned spiral, concentrated towards the centre. the\\nstructure of this complete system remained stabilized for the\\nnext billions of years. the surviving matter did not fall into\\nthe black hole due to its distance. neither did it shatter away\\nbecause of the gravitational attraction and kept on steadily\\nrevolving around the black hole. as time passed, the matter\\nrevolving around the black hole started forming its own stars,\\nplanets, and eventually solar systems. this complete structure\\nis known as a galaxy. this is why there is a supermassive black\\nhole at the centre of almost every galaxy in the universe.\\ngalaxies are being formed till this day; it is found that nearly\\nall the galaxies we see today were formed shortly after big\\nbang. we found that the foggy universe transformed into a\\nclear sky, and we can see distant parts of the space as a result of\\nthe formation of galaxies. our milky way galaxy is considered\\nto be formed at the beginning of the universe roughly 13.6\\nbillion years ago. there are about two hundred billion or more\\nstars in our milky way galaxy.\\nwe are not sure whether the stars formed first and then\\ngathered into galaxies or the galactic clouds formed first\\nwherein the first stars were born. it is possible that the galaxies\\n83\\nearly stars and galaxies\\nformed where the dark matter and regular matter clumped\\ntogether due to the irregularities in distribution left over from\\nthe big bang. the earliest galaxies we can see are around 13.8\\nbillion light-years away, allowing us to see the earliest pieces of\\nstuff in the universe and the beginning of the universe itself.\\nhd 140283\\nhd 140283 is one of the oldest stars in the universe. it is so\\nold that it is also known as the methuselah star. astronomers\\nhave known about this star for more than a hundred years, but\\nat that time, we did not have the instruments to measure its\\nage and distance. hd 140283 is located ~200 light-years away\\nfrom earth in the constellation of libra. the study of hd\\n140283 is the study of our early universe. it helps us understand\\nhow the universe looked like soon after the big bang. this star\\nmust have formed soon after the big bang.\\nthere is a big debate on the age of this star. some scientists\\npredict it to be ~14.5 â± 0.8 billion years old, whereas new\\nresearch shows that it is at least 13.2 billion years old. if hd\\n140283 is ~14.5 â± 0.8 billion years old, then our books must\\nbe rewritten because that means our universe is at least 14.5\\nbillion years old and older than our current estimate. our\\ncurrent observations show that the universe is 13.8 billion\\nyears old.\\nsince this star is so far, scientists are not able to determine its\\nage correctly. based upon the light we are receiving from it, we\\nhave calculated its age with an uncertainty of 800 million years.\\nthis means hd 140283 could be 13.7 billion years old, which\\nis younger than the universe and fits our current understanding.\\nif not, then we must change our understanding.\\n84\\nbaby universe\\ngn-z11\\nit is essential to talk about gn-z11 because it is one of the\\noldest, if not the oldest, galaxy found in the constellation ursa\\nmajor. gn-z11 is also the most distant known galaxy in the\\nobservable universe. this galaxy was first identified in march\\n2016. scientists observed gn-z11 as it was 13.4 billion years\\nago, just 400 million years after the big bang. sometimes\\ngn-z11 distance gets reported to be 13.4 billion light-years\\naway from us, which is wrong. due to rapid expansion of the\\nuniverse, the current location of this galaxy is approximately 32\\nbillion light-years from us.\\ngn-z11 belongs to the very first stars and galaxies that were\\nformed after the big bang. it is one of the very first populations\\nof stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. when this\\ngalaxy was born, the universe was emerging from a period\\nknown as the dark ages. during the dark ages, there was\\nnothing but complete darkness in the universe. stars that make\\nour universe shine did not exist. however, that era did not last\\ntoo long as new stars and galaxies began to form as soon as the\\nuniverse cooled down, and matter came into existence. gnz11\\ndoes not have a massive size; it is roughly 1â„25 of the size\\nof our milky way galaxy, or we can say it is 25 times smaller.\\nit is not much heavier either and has just 1% of the mass of\\nour galaxy.\\nall galaxies form new stars at a specific rate, depending on\\nthe amount of gases and dust present in them. but gnz11 is\\nforming new stars at 20 times the rate of our milky way, which\\nproves that at the beginning of the universe, galaxies formed\\nstars rather quickly. since it is forming stars very quickly, it is\\n85\\nearly stars and galaxies\\nvery bright, making it possible for astronomers to detect it.\\nobserving gn-z11 is a significant step back in time; it is like\\nlooking at creation itself in its earliest form. when we observe\\ngn-z11, we are observing the very beginning of the universe.\\nbecause light from such a distant galaxy travels vast distances\\nto reach earth, when we look at gn-z11, we are looking at it\\nas it was 13.4 billion years ago.\\n86\\nsupernova\\nwe all are stardust; we are made out of it. a supernova is an event that releases an enormous amount of energy in a short period of time. from our understanding so far, supernovas are the ones that created the building blocks required for life. majority of stars in the universe are average in size. they are born, they light up the space around them, and after a few billion years, they become red giants. after becoming a red giant, their luminosity keeps decreasing with time, and they fade away. before fading away, their temperature reaches so low that you can touch those stars with bare hands, they are colder than a cup of coffee.\\nour sun itself is an average-sized star and is one of them. it has been around for over 4.6 billion years and will be around for the same time, but many things will change in the future. in about 110 million years from now, our sunâ€™s luminosity will increase by over 1 percent. this increase will not make much impact, but it will threaten life on earth. in about 1.1 billion years from now, sunâ€™s luminosity will increase by 10 percent, causing average earthâ€™s temperatures to reach over 45 â°c. this would be a severe threat not just to humans but also to all life on earth. by this time, almost all species would have died on earth. earthâ€™s atmosphere will become a moist greenhouse, and our oceans will evaporate at an alarming rate. no life can survive in such an environment.\\n87\\nsupernova\\nin about 5.4 billion years from now, the sunâ€™s hydrogen supply\\nwill get exhausted at its core, and there would be no more fuel\\nfor fusion to occur. as a result, the sun will leave as the main\\nsequence star and begins to evolve into a red giant. soon after\\nbecoming a red giant, our sun will start expanding due to which\\nearth will receive more light and become hotter every day. just\\nwithin the next few million years, it will consume mercury. in\\nabout 7.6 billion years from now, the sun will have expanded\\nso much that it will consume our home planet.\\nby the time the sun is 8 billion years old, it will contract quickly,\\nbecoming a white dwarf star. in this process of quick expansion\\nand contraction, sun will lose over 50% of its current mass.\\nwhite dwarf stars do not emit as much energy as a regular\\nstar. so, by this time, if somehow our planet survives and does\\nnot get eaten by the sun, its surface temperature will begin\\ndropping rapidly. in about one quadrillion years, the sun will\\nhave cooled to five degrees above absolute zero. it will be so\\ncold that you would not be able to touch its surface by bare\\nhands. by this time, the sun will not be shining at all. it would\\nbe a black dwarf with no emitting light. its core would also\\nhave cooled down significantly, and the process of fusion would\\nstop completely.\\nmost of the stars in our universe are average-sized, so most of\\nthem will die like our sun, but not all of them. all the stars we\\nsee in the night sky will use all their energy and will be gone\\none day. what happens before that depends upon their mass.\\nas we have described above, stars whose mass is 0-8 times that\\nof the sun will die like the sun.\\nstars whose mass is 8 to 20 times the mass of the sun will have\\n88\\nbaby universe\\na different fate. the process of fusion and converting hydrogen\\ninto helium occurs at a much faster rate at their core due to\\ntheir massive size. the gravitational force of the star keeps the\\npressure at its core; at the same time, the fusion at its core\\nexerts pressure outwards. this pressure is in equilibrium in all\\nthe stable stars like our sun. however, by the time stars use all\\nof their fuel, and there is no more fuel to burn, this equilibrium\\ngets disturbed.\\nstars whose mass is 8 to 20 times the mass of our sun collapse\\ninto themselves due to this pressure difference and boom. a\\nsupernova explosion occurs. the bigger the star is, the bigger\\nthe supernova explosion it will be. these stars light up the\\nentire galaxy with their explosion before dying. the effects\\nof their explosion can be seen in nearby galaxies and can be\\ndetected thousands of lights years away. with their explosive\\nend, these stars create the building blocks required for the\\nevolution of life. our element factory (stars) cannot form\\nheavier elements like iron, gold, etc. on a large scale through\\nfusion. their inner core temperature can only fuse hydrogen\\ninto helium and some sort of lithium in massive stars. so, if\\nwe want to create large amounts of heavier elements, we need\\na very high temperature and pressure. nothing can bring this\\ntemperature except when a star collapses into itself and blows\\nup in the form of a supernova.\\nsupernova explosion provides enough energy at the core of a\\nstar so it can form the heavier elements. supernova explosions\\ngave us different materials; the carbon that we are made\\nof, the iron from which our vehicles are made, and the gold\\njewellery that we wear, all of it came from those early supernova\\nexplosions. during the explosion, the inner temperature of the\\n89\\nsupernova\\nstar reaches the millions of degrees, enabling nuclei to fuse\\ninto each other and result in heavy metals/elements. we have\\niron in our blood, which is a result of a supernova itself.\\nheavy elements are not the only things that these stars leave\\nbehind. neutron stars are also born from these explosions.\\nwhen giant stars die in the form of supernova explosions, their\\ncores collapse. this pressure and temperature are unimaginable.\\nit forces protons and electrons to melt into each other to form\\nneutrons. so eventually, what we have is a massive ball of\\nneutrons, which we also call as neutron stars.\\nin simple terms, a neutron star is the remnant core of a collapsed\\nstar born from the explosive death of another, more massive\\nstar. neutron stars are typically tiny but extremely heavy. they\\nhave a radius of roughly 12 kilometres, but their mass could\\nbe 1.4 to 2.2 times that of the sun. neutron stars are the\\ntiniest and densest stars ever known to exist. their density can\\nbe imagined from the fact that one teaspoon of neutron star\\nmaterial would weigh roughly 10 million tons. neutron stars\\nalso rotate very fast; they can rotate up to 43,000 rotations per\\nminute and not fall apart. it has been predicted that our milky\\nway galaxy alone hosts 100 million neutron stars. most of the\\nneutron stars that we have observed are extremely hot, where\\ntheir surface temperature can reach 60,000k, comparing that\\nof our sun, which is 6,000k.\\npulsars are also born the same way. as we know, almost all\\nstars rotate about their axis. however, when it goes supernova,\\nit loses a lot of its mass. so, in order to maintain its angular\\nmomentum, the remaining star, the neutron star, must spin\\nfaster. when a neutron star spins that fast, it blasts small\\n90\\nbaby universe\\nbeams of radiation along its magnetic field lines. when we\\nobserve such stars from the earth, we see pulsating beams of\\nlight. so instead of calling them average neutron stars, we call\\nthem pulsars.\\nwe have talked about small and medium-sized stars. it is time\\nto talk about stars that are heavier than 20 times the mass\\nof our sun. whenever these massive stars run out of fuel,\\ninstead of collapsing into themselves and then exploding into\\na supernova, they simply collapse into themselves, forming a\\nblack hole. we will talk about black holes in detail in the\\nnext chapter.\\nsupernova is one of the most extreme events in the universe.\\nwhen we talk about a supernova, we talk about a star exploding\\ninto bits and pieces in a small fraction of a second. an entire\\nstar collapses, creating either neutron stars or black holes.\\nthey release more energy in a fraction of a second that our sun\\nwill release in millions of years. supernovas are characterized\\ninto two different categories, i.e., type-1 and type-2. this\\ndistinction is generally based upon their dramatic way of\\nexplosion and the type of star involved.\\n91\\nsupernova\\ntype 1 supernova: this type of supernova involves white\\ndwarf stars. these types of supernovas are rare because they\\nrequire a binary star system. white dwarfs are quite stable, and\\nthey do not explode on their own, they need a companion star\\nto do so. this companion star can be a red giant, a regular sun\\nsized star, or even another white dwarf. as the other star gets\\ncloser to a white dwarf, it starts stealing matter from it just like\\na black hole. as a result, the mass of white dwarf increases\\ndramatically. white dwarf steals the matter and builds a\\nblanket of new matter around itself. when this stolen matter\\ngets too much, more than 1.4 times the mass of our sun, it\\nreaches a critical point. due to this sudden increase in mass,\\nthe white dwarf becomes unstable and explodes as a supernova.\\ntype 2 supernova: we have already talked about this type of\\nsupernova, but let us look at it again. suppose a star is finely\\nbalanced. finely balanced means that the coreâ€™s gravitational\\npressure is equal to the pressure generated by the starâ€™s fusion\\nprocess. but when the fuel of a star runs out dramatically, the\\ninternal and external pressure becomes unbalanced. since the\\nnuclear reactions have nearly stopped the pressure inside the\\nstar, the star starts collapsing into itself. the complete star\\ncollapses into a minimal point and explodes. everything that\\nstar used to consist of falls apart in a sudden moment. type-\\n2 supernovae usually occur in giant stars because such stars\\nuse their fuel very quickly. our sun is an average star, so the\\nchances of this type of end for our sun are nearly zero.\\nsupernovae are rare; they are not easy to detect even in our\\ngalaxy. since the invention of the telescope, we have been able\\nto observe only around ten supernova explosions in our milky\\nway galaxy. astronomer johannes kepler in 1604 observed one\\n92\\nbaby universe\\nof the first supernovae seen in the milky way galaxy. he observed\\nthis supernova even before the invention of the telescope, with\\nthe naked eye. however, calculations show that there should be\\na minimum of three of these explosions occurring in a century\\nin our milky way galaxy. now we can only see the dust left\\nbehind by the supernovae. it is possible that the atoms you are\\nmade up of came from a supernova that occurred billions of\\nyears ago in a faraway galaxy. it is also possible that the atoms\\nyou are made of once were once a part of albert einstein.\\nscientists have used the supernova explosions to measure the\\nage of the universe, which we know today to be nearly 13.8\\nbillion years. galaxies that are located thousands of lightyears\\naway, their distance can also be measured by observing\\ntheir supernova explosions. the shine and light originated by a\\ndistant supernova are measured, and later this data is compared\\nwith the supernova explosions that occurred in a nearby galaxy.\\nby comparing the data, we can calculate the distance where\\nit occurred in a distant galaxy and its distance from us. as a\\nresult of multiple observations from supernovae, we found the\\nuniverse is not slowing down at all, it is speeding up, opposite\\nto what we expected earlier and were looking for. that is how\\nscience surprises us all the time, we were looking for a universe\\nwhich is slowing down, but we found the opposite results.\\nwhy didnâ€™t the early universe create heavier elements?\\nit is natural to ask why the universe didnâ€™t create heavier\\nelements by itself in the beginning. the universe could have\\nbeen forming the heavier elements during its early age when\\nthe temperature was high enough. however, we must not\\nforget that it was expanding rapidly, causing the temperature to\\n93\\nsupernova\\nlower quickly. because of this rapid expansion, the probability\\nof multiple protons colliding under high temperature came\\ndown. apart from hydrogen and a little bit of helium, it is\\npossible that a minor amount of lithium was also created at\\nthe beginning. primarily due to expansion, no other heavy\\nelements were created.\\nbetelgeuse\\nbetelgeuse is one of the shiniest stars of our night sky. when\\nyou are stargazing from your roof, one of the stars you see in\\nthe sky may be betelgeuse. betelgeuse is critical to learn about\\nbecause it can go supernova anytime in the future. betelgeuse is\\na red supergiant star located 642 light-years away from earth.\\nthis is a massive star with a diameter of ~1.2 billion km. this\\nstar is very young, roughly 10 million years old, much younger\\nthan our sun. but due to its humongous size, it is burning its\\nfuel very rapidly, creating heavier elements at the core. some\\nastronomers suspect that this star may go supernova within\\nthe next 100,000 years. one million years is the maximum\\nestimated time until this red supergiant star explodes.\\nwhen betelgeuse explodes, it will light up our sky for several\\nmonths. its light will be so bright that it will be visible from\\nearth even during daytime. at the end of the year 2019,\\nastronomers noticed that betelgeuse is dimming in brightness.\\nrecent high-resolution images show that betelgeuse is going\\nthrough some internal changes; we do not know what they\\nare. it is fading and changing its shape; instead of a sphere,\\nit appears squashed into an oval. some astronomers suspect\\nthat betelgeuse has exploded already, and we do not have to\\nwait 100,000 years to see this supernova. but the problem is\\n94\\nbaby universe\\nthe distance, and betelgeuse is located 642 light-years away,\\nwhich means light takes 642 years to reach our planet after it\\nexplodes. so, all we can do is wait and watch the sky.\\n95\\nblack holes\\nour universe is full of magical things, and black holes are one of them. as we spread our arms more in-depth into the universe, we observe the beauty it is confined with and witness the impossible things happening out there. scientists speak in a different tone when it comes to a black hole. for some, they could be the pathways to new dimensions, whereas for others, black holes are nothing but an ultra-dense space which does not let anything come out. black holes contain one of the mysterious places of the universe that are beyond our reach, a singularity.\\nblack holes were suggested by the astronomical pioneer john michell. he predicted that when a body is so dense that its escape velocity is close to the speed of light, it will turn into a black hole. he said that we could only observe them by their gravitational effects. a few months later, when einstein developed his theory of relativity, karl schwarzschild found a solution to einsteinâ€™s equations explaining the gravitational field of a spherical point mass. based on the explanation given by albert einstein, the black hole curves the space-time fabric more than anything else because of their infinite density. we can say black holes curve space-time, and as light travels through that curved space, it bends forever and is never able to come out of that region. it is said that black holes are not really black, but instead are the brightest objects in the universe; they\\n96\\nbaby universe\\njust do not allow the light to reflect.\\nour milky way galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars,\\nand we can assume that a minimum of one out of 100 stars has\\nenough mass to end up as a black hole. according to this rough\\napproximation, there are more than 100 million black holes in\\nour galaxy alone. there are 200 billion to two trillion galaxies\\nin the universe now, you can calculate how many black holes\\nare there in total. almost all the galaxies have a host black\\nhole, located at the very centre. this black hole holds the entire\\ngalaxy together and does not let it fall apart. our galaxy, milky\\nway, also has a supermassive black hole at the centre known as\\nsagittarius a*.\\nwe have already discussed the supernova explosions for small,\\nmedium and massive stars, it will either be a type-1 or a type-\\n2. when a star whose mass is more than 20 times the mass\\nof our sun dies, it collapses into itself and finally becomes a\\nblack hole. the star collapses into itself and turns into a point\\nof singularity with infinite density and gravitational attraction.\\nin general, a black hole is a place in the space where the\\ngravitational force is so much that not even light can escape.\\nthe gravity of that space is extremely strong due to matter\\nbeing squeezed into a tiny space. black holes come in different\\nsizes, depending upon the amount of matter they have sucked\\nup into themselves and the mass of the star that resulted in\\ntheir formation. there are black holes with a diameter equal\\nto that of an asteroid, while some others are supermassive, like\\nthose found at the core of every galaxy. there are four types\\nof known black holes, stellar, intermediate, supermassive, and\\nminiature. we will talk about them later.\\n97\\nblack holes\\nin order to understand a black hole better, let us try and get\\ninto one. suppose you have a spaceship that can take you to a\\nblack hole within a matter of a few hours using a wormhole.\\nnow let us find out what will happen as you approach the\\nblack hole. you will get stretched like spaghetti, your body will\\nbreak down to atoms, and you will die much before reaching\\nthe black hole in a process called spaghettification. however,\\nin our case, we are assuming that the black holeâ€™s gravity has\\nno impact on you.\\naccretion disk\\nas you get near a black hole, you will first encounter the\\naccretion disk. accretion disk is a disc of superheated gases\\nand dust swirling around the black hole at a very high speed.\\nthis superheated gas produces the electromagnetic radiations\\n(such as x-rays) that we generally use to locate a black hole.\\nmatter from accretion disk falls into the black hole, giving it\\nmore strength. it is like the lunch of a black hole, which gives\\nit more energy.\\ninnermost stable orbit\\nas we move through the accretion disk towards the centre of\\nthe black hole, the next place we will encounter is the innermost\\nstable orbit. this orbit is the inner edge of the accretion disk.\\nit is generally the last place where we can turn back and come\\nout safely. once we cross this point, there is no going back. in\\nsimple words, it is the last stable circular orbit with a minimum\\nradius for a particle to revolve around the black hole.\\nphoton sphere\\njust before falling into the black hole, we will encounter the\\n98\\nbaby universe\\nphoton sphere. the photon sphere is a spherical region around\\nthe black hole where gravity is so strong that even photons\\n(light particles) are forced to travel in orbits. this means the\\nblack holeâ€™s gravity bends their path, and thus, they are forced\\nto orbit the black hole until they fall into it or spiral out into\\nspace.\\nevent horizon\\nin simple words, event horizon is the point of no return. once\\nyou cross the event horizon, you are forever stuck inside the\\nblack hole, and there is no way out. event horizon itself is the\\nradius around the singularity, it is a boundary that separates\\nthe black hole from the rest of the space. the escape velocity\\nfor an object within the event horizon exceeds the speed of\\nlight. you must travel faster than the speed light to get out of\\nthe event horizon. physics says that by traveling faster than the\\nspeed of light, you will get out of a black hole, but practically\\nit is not possible. neither is it possible to reach a velocity close\\nto the speed of light.\\nsingularity\\nafter crossing the event horizon, we come to the singularity. it\\nlies at the very centre of a black hole. singularity is the place\\nwhere matter has collapsed into a point of infinite density. all\\nthe matter that falls into a black hole eventually ends up here.\\nwe are not sure about this point of singularity and what it is.\\nsingularity is still a point of discussion among scientists. we\\nknow all the laws of physics of the current day break down at\\nthe singularity, making it hard to get to a final conclusion.\\n99\\nblack holes\\nhawking radiations\\nblack holes may seem to be stable, but they are not. they\\nevaporate in the form of hawking radiations. the bigger the\\nblack hole, the faster it evaporates in the form of hawking\\nradiations. stephen hawking explains it in terms of space and\\nhow it works. free space does not mean nothing, it consists\\nof particles and antiparticles that come into existence, soon\\nafter they inhale and destroy each other. this process goes on\\ncontinuously and everywhere in space.\\nthe same process of creation and inhalation of particles occurs\\nnear the black hole. but what about at the event horizon?\\nit is said that at the event horizon as soon as particles and\\nantiparticles form, one of them gets sucked into the black\\nhole while the other particles stay out. the other particle may\\nescape and have no one to pair with. the particles come out\\nin the form of radiation that we call hawking radiation. the\\nprocess reduces the life of a black hole, but this process is quite\\n100\\nbaby universe\\nslow. given enough time, the black hole will radiate away its\\nmass and eventually vanish, but if it continues acquiring more\\nmatter, it will not be effective.\\nbased upon their mass and how they are formed, black holes are\\ndivided into four categories, stellar, intermediate, supermassive,\\nand miniature.\\nstellar black holes\\nstellar black holes are the common type of black holes. these\\nblack holes are formed by a stellar death. as stars reach the end\\nof their lives, most of them inflate, lose mass, and eventually\\nbecome white dwarfs. however, as we talked about earlier,\\nstars whose mass is more than 20 times the mass of our sun\\nbecome a black hole. these black holes are known as stellar\\nblack holes. stellar black holes can be found in almost every\\ngalaxy and everywhere in the universe. their mass is generally\\n5 to several tens of solar masses.\\nintermediate mass black holes\\nintermediate mass black holes are a particular class of black\\nholes. these black holes have a mass of 100 to 100,000 times\\nthe mass of our sun. intermediate mass black holes are\\nmassive compared to the stellar black holes but smaller than\\nthe supermassive black holes. several intermediate mass black\\nholes have been found in our milky way galaxy. by observing\\nthe gas clouds and accretion disk, scientists were able to trace\\ntheir presence.\\nsupermassive black holes\\nas their name suggests, supermassive black holes are heavy.\\n101\\nblack holes\\nthey are one of the most massive objects in the universe, only\\nbehind a galaxy itself. their mass is in the order of hundreds\\nof thousands to billions of times the mass of the sun.\\nastronomers suggest that supermassive black holes formed\\nfrom the collapse of massive clouds of gas during the early\\nstages of the formation of a galaxy. as a result, supermassive\\nblack holes are generally found at the centre of most galaxies.\\nmore prominent the galaxy is, the bigger its central black hole\\nmust be. at the centre of our galaxy, there is a supermassive\\nblack hole called sagittarius a*.\\nsagittarius a* is located roughly 26,000 light-years from\\nearth. it has a diameter of roughly 44 million km and a mass\\nof 41 million times the mass of our sun. sagittarius a* is also\\na powerful radio source, giving off strong radio waves, likely\\noriginating from the matter orbiting around it. astronomers\\nhave not seen sagittarius a* with a telescope since it does not\\nemit any light. instead, they have noticed the motion of stars\\naround this black hole. they observed that a strong source of\\ngravity is making other stars move strangely. only a very dense\\nobject with the mass of millions of times the mass of the sun\\ncan make it happen. there is nothing like that except a black\\nhole.\\nminiature black holes\\nminiature black holes are hypothetical tiny black holes. they\\nhave a shallow mass. the concept that miniature black holes\\nmay exist was introduced in 1971 by stephen hawking. the\\nproblem with miniature black holes is their small size. even if\\nthey are formed, they would radiate away almost instantly. some\\nscientists predict that miniature black holes can be formed due\\n102\\nbaby universe\\nto the high energies available in particle accelerators, such\\nas the large hadron collider. when this theory first came,\\npeople were worried about the possibility of a miniature black\\nhole forming inside the lhc and getting bigger by sucking\\nthe entire planet.\\nfirst image of black hole\\npreviously it was thought impossible to capture the image of a\\nblack hole because they do not let even light escape. however,\\nwith the advancement in technology, scientists have made it\\npossible. we have been studying black holes for a very long\\ntime, but none of us had seen one until very recently. messier\\n87 is an elliptical galaxy located in the constellation virgo. it is\\none of the most massive galaxies observed in the universe. it is\\nlocated about 53 million light-years away from earth.\\nat the heart of messier 87 galaxy, there is a supermassive black\\nhole, designated m87* with a mass billions of times that of\\nthe sun. astronomers used the event horizon telescope\\nto study this black hole, and based upon the data gathered\\nfrom this source, they have created the very first image of the\\nblack hole. this image contains a rotating disk of ionized gas\\nsurrounding the black hole. matter continuously falls into the\\nblack hole and keeps feeding it. the disk rotates at a very high\\nspeed of roughly 1,000 km/s. this might seem small, but this\\nsupermassive black hole contains a mass of roughly 6.5 billion\\nsuns.\\nuntil now, we had only seen the indirect evidence of black\\nholes. we were able to study the high energy jets shooting\\nstraight from them. we were able to study the x-rays coming\\nfrom the matter circling the black hole. not just x-rays, we\\n103\\nblack holes\\nwere also able to detect the gravitational waves supposed to be\\ncoming out of colliding black holes. however, the discovery of\\nan actual image of a black hole in 2019 is one of the biggest\\nlandmarks in human history.\\nthis is what a living black hole looks like.\\nwhat would happen if a black hole replaced our sun?\\nif a black hole replaced our sun, many things would happen.\\nfirst, we will not even notice it for the first 8.2 minutes because\\nthat is the time light takes to reach us from our star. after\\n8.2 minutes, everything will get darker since black holes do\\nnot emit any light. what happens to all the planets depends\\nupon the size of the black hole. if the black holeâ€™s gravitational\\nattraction is the same as the sun, then we will not notice\\nanything significant except darkness. however, our planet\\nwill not become completely dark because the light of distant\\nstars will still be reaching us. if the black hole is too small and\\ndoes not have much gravitational force, planets will drift away\\n104\\nbaby universe\\ntangentially into space. if it is too massive, all the planets may\\neven fall into it.\\nsuppose the gravitational strength of the black hole is as much\\nas the sun. in that case, we will neither fall nor shoot away\\ninto space, but we will have to find a suitable place to keep us\\nwarm. after the first 24 hours, earthâ€™s temperature will start\\ndropping significantly, and the planet will start cooling down.\\nwithin the first month, all the plants will die in the absence of\\nsunlight, which is required for photosynthesis. in the absence\\nof plants, all the herbivores will die out, and in the absence of\\nherbivore all the carnivores will die too. the planet will get\\nso cold that our oceans will start freezing. humans will move\\ntowards hot places such as volcanoes to become warm and stay\\nalive, but due to the lack of resources, they will not survive for\\ntoo long.\\nif black holes are black, how do we know that they are actually\\nthere?\\na black hole cannot be seen directly because of its strong gravity\\npulling all the light towards the singularity. scientists can\\nobserve the effects of black holeâ€™s strong gravity on the stars\\nand gases that are orbiting around it. if a star is continuously\\norbiting a point in space and it is not clear what it is orbiting\\naround, we can study its motion and see if that point is a black\\nhole. generally, high-energy light is produced when a star and\\nblack hole are orbiting closely.\\na black holeâ€™s gravity can sometimes pull the outer gases of a\\nstar. however, that gas does not directly fall into it; some of it\\ndoes, but most of it starts orbiting around it in the accretion\\ndisk. as the gas from the accretion disk orbits the black hole,\\n105\\nblack holes\\nit gets heated to the point that it starts releasing x-ray light in\\nall directions. space telescopes can measure this x-ray light.\\nusually, astronomers use this information to learn more about\\nthe properties of a black hole.\\n106\\nour solar system\\nin the most straightforward language, a solar system is nothing but an arrangement of one or more planets around a star. for us, the star is our sun, just look upwards while it is daytime and you will find out for yourself. the journey for the formation of our solar system started more than 5 billion years ago when there was a massive dust and gas cloud, mostly containing hydrogen gas. at the very centre of that gas cloud, a new star was being born, and that was our sun. five billion years ago from today, there was no sign for a thing called a planet, let alone a blue planet. however, as the solar dust cleared, gravity began to cause bits of matter to clump together, forming a large number of planets, and there was a beautiful structure around this newly born star. in the beginning, there were 100â€™s of planets in our solar system, but not all of them had a stable orbit. some of them collided with each other forming bigger planets whereas others fell into the sun.\\nwith every impact, planets grew. the planets moving faster, having large orbits and not too far from the sun, grew rapidly because they swiped more matter while revolving around the sun. jupiter is an excellent example of that. mars also could have been a massive planet, but it could not get enough matter in its orbit. it is hard to believe that dust clouds combined forming planets in a process that took millions of years. not to\\n107\\nour solar system\\nmention that our earth was made in the same way.\\nmost of these planets were nothing but a hot ball of lava, whose\\nsurface temperature was close or more than 1000â€™s of degrees.\\nthose planets had an atmosphere full of co2, nitrogen, and\\nother harmful gases. planets were a boiling ball where volcanic\\nactivity was widespread. these were the inner planets of the\\nsolar system; for the other planets of the solar system, things\\nwere totally different. almost all the outer planets of our solar\\nsystem are gas giants whose density is so low that if you stand\\nover their surface, you will descend forever and stop at their\\ncore.\\nthe sun\\nwe have already discussed how the sun will die, but there are\\ncertain things that we must know about our host star. sun\\ndominates the solar system with around 99.8% of total mass.\\nour solar system is an average 27,000 light-years away from\\nthe centre of the milky way galaxy. nearly 3/4 portion of the\\nsun is pure hydrogen, approx. 1/4 portion of sun is helium,\\nwhile there is a negligible amount of heavy elements such as\\noxygen, carbon, iron, neon, nitrogen, etc. the core of our sun\\nis millions of degrees hot, where the process of converting light\\nelements into heavier elements occurs. sun orbits at a speed of\\n~220 km/sec around the centre of the milky way galaxy. our\\nentire solar system also moves at the same speed, but we do not\\nnotice any of it because we live in the protective atmosphere\\nof earth. if we compare our central star with earth, it has 109\\ntimes the radius and around 333,000 times the mass of earth.\\nthe escape velocity from the outer surface of the sun is also\\nvery high, around 617 km/sec, 55 times that of earth.\\n108\\nbaby universe\\nthe rate at which stars use their fuel in the form of fusion to\\nconvert lighter elements into heavier elements depends upon\\ntheir mass. a massive star has more pressure at the core, thus\\nconverting more mass and vice versa. being an average-sized\\nstar, the rate of energy consumption of the sun is very low. the\\nsun we see today is likely the same as it was 4 billion years ago\\nand will be the same for the coming 2-3 billion years, except\\nthat its luminosity will increase with time. the distance between\\nour sun and earth is used as a parameter (astronomical unit or\\nau) to measure the various solar distances. the average distance\\nbetween sun and earth is about 150,000,000 km or 93 million\\nmiles, while one astronomical unit equals 149,597,870 km.\\nwe have a stable future because we have a stable host star\\nsupporting life on earth with its light. all the plant life uses\\nthe same light for photosynthesis and gives us oxygen to\\nbreathe. the amount of sunlight we receive here on earth is\\nmeagre, it is just a small fraction of the energy that the sun\\nreleases every moment.\\nwe might feel unique about ourselves, but our solar system\\nis not unique at all. in fact, it is just one of the billions of\\nsolar systems in the universe. however, something it contains\\nmakes it unique, i.e., life. the solar systemâ€™s arrangement comes\\nwith eight planets surrounding the sun. not just the planets,\\nbut all other objects are also centred about the sun. the\\nmassive gravity of our sun is holding all the planets, comets,\\nasteroids and dwarf planets of the solar system together. as\\nyou are reading this book, our planet is not just rotating; it\\nis also revolving around the sun. our sun is orbiting around\\nthe centre of the milky way galaxy, which has its own moving\\nspeed in the universe. this is mind-blowing to think about.\\n109\\nour solar system\\nour sun is essential because its heat keeps us alive, and its\\nenergy enables plants to do photosynthesis. billions of years\\nago, where there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, the sun\\nprovided energy to the stromatolites, which later filled our\\natmosphere with oxygen. in the absence of the sun, our oceans\\nwould freeze, and no signs of life will remain on earth. today\\nwe know of 8 major planets and many other minor planets that\\nwere not in the list of planets destroyed by the sun. let us go\\nbeyond the sun and explore what is there:\\nmercury\\nthe very first planet from the sun is also the smallest planet\\nof our solar system, mercury. mercury has a rocky surface\\nwith a large number of craters on it, much like the dark side\\nof our moon. these craters show that brutal bombarding that\\nhappened for billions of years after the formation of mercury.\\nmercury is one of two planets of our solar system that do not\\nhave a moon, neither does it have a healthy atmosphere like\\nearth. it has a fragile atmosphere, which consists of hydrogen,\\nhelium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium, and water vapor.\\nbeing the closest planet to our sun, mercury has a high surface\\ntemperature, which can reach above 420 degrees celsius.\\nmercury is tidally locked with our sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit\\nresonance. this means that relative to the sun, it rotates on\\nits axis three times for every two revolutions it makes around\\nthe sun. the side of mercury which faces the sun has a very\\nhigh temperature, whereas the opposite dark side has freezing\\ntemperatures. the scenario can be understood by imagining\\nthat you are standing on mercury. you bring your one hand\\ndirectly to the sunlight and put the other hand in the dark,\\n110\\nbaby universe\\none hand will be burned due to the intense heat, whereas the\\nother hand will freeze. as a result of this dramatic temperature\\nvariation, there are no chances to survive on this planet.\\nmercury takes only 88 earth days to complete one revolution\\naround the sun, making it the fastest planet to do so in our\\nsolar system. most of the parts of mercury are metallic, which\\ngives it a high density of 5.51 g/cmâ³. its density is slightly\\nlower than earth, making it the second most dense planet in\\nour solar system.\\nvenus\\nthe next planet is venus. venus is very similar in physical\\ncharacteristics such as size, mass, gravity, etc. to earth. due\\nto this fact, venus is also called earthâ€™s sister planet. the inner\\ncore conditions of venus are also supposed to be the same as\\nearth. venus has an atmosphere mostly consisting of carbon\\ndioxide, about 96% carbon dioxide, and more than 3.5%\\nnitrogen. being closer to the sun, venus receives much more\\nsunlight than earth. most of the sunlight gets trapped by the\\ncarbon dioxide in its atmosphere and is unable to leave. this\\nraises the overall temperature of venus, which can reach up\\nto 460 degrees celsius, making it the hottest planet revolving\\naround the sun.\\nvenus has clouds of sulfuric acid, so whenever it rains, sulfuric\\nacid drops from the sky, which is a very horrifying scene to\\nimagine. the presence of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere and\\nthe high temperature makes it unsuitable for life. also, venus\\nhas a massive atmosphere giving it a surface pressure of around\\n93 times as that of earth. venus takes around 224.7 days to\\ncomplete a single revolution around the sun. after the moon,\\n111\\nour solar system\\nvenus is the second brightest natural object in the night sky.\\nit looks like a small bright spot when observed with the naked\\neye.\\nearth\\nthe third planet from the sun is our home planet, earth. just\\nlook down at the ground, that is earth. earth is neither hot\\nnor cold; it is perfect for the growth and well-being of life.\\nearth is the only planet we know today that supports life. we\\nwill briefly discuss this planet in a later chapter.\\nmars\\nthe fourth planet is mars. because of the abundant presence\\nof iron oxide in its atmosphere, mars is commonly known as\\nthe red planet. mars is smaller than venus and earth, but it\\nis much larger than mercury. mars has a fragile atmosphere\\nconsisting of co2 and oxygen. the presence of water as ice\\nover a large part of mars makes it an exciting planet that could\\nsupport life in the future with the help of some equipment.\\ndiscovery of water as ice on mars directly points out that\\nthis planet may have supported life in its past, but due to the\\nsolar storms and lack of magnetic shield, mars not only lost its\\natmosphere but also the oceans of water on it. mars is the next\\ntarget of nasa and many other space research organizations\\nto land a person on its surface after the moon. humans could\\nnot land on its surface, but our rovers have already reached\\nthere, and curiosity rover is one of them.\\nafter earth, mars is the next planet that has its own moon.\\nthe beauty of mars is enhanced by its two moons, phobos\\nand deimos. its moons are not as big as our moon is, nor are\\n112\\nbaby universe\\nthey round like ours, but they are beautiful. because of their\\ndramatic structure, scientists believe that these two moons\\nmight be some captured asteroids. they might have come from\\nthe asteroid belt between mars and jupiter.\\nasteroid belt\\nthe asteroid belt is located between the inner and outer planet\\nof our solar system, i.e., mars and jupiter. it contains a large\\nnumber of asteroids orbiting the sun just like other planets.\\nthere are hundreds of thousands of asteroids in the asteroid\\nbelt, but almost half of its mass is made up by 4 significant\\nasteroids. these are ceres, vesta, pallas, and hygiea. among\\nthese asteroids, ceres is the only asteroid that is also designated\\nas a dwarf planet. this means it is neither too small to be a\\nproper asteroid nor too big to be considered a planet. ceres\\nhas a diameter of about 946 kilometres. asteroid belt is a part\\nof various solid asteroids, comets and irregularly shaped bodies\\nwhere some objects are as small as a particle, whereas others\\nare over 900 kilometres wide.\\nthere are two leading theories as to what made the asteroid\\nbelt. the first theory is that it is just as it was at the beginning\\nof the solar system. when our solar system was forming, gas\\nand dust combined forming small asteroids and comets, but it\\ncould not form a proper planet. it would make a good smallsized\\nplanet if we collect all the mass of the asteroid belt. since\\nasteroids were not able to combine, they are as they were since\\nthe beginning. if that is the case, then it must be much denser\\nwith many more asteroids and comets in the beginning. every\\nnow and then, we observe asteroids and comets leaving the\\nasteroid belt in the influence of the gravitational force of either\\n113\\nour solar system\\nmars, jupiter, or even its own objects. those asteroids and\\ncomets either fall into the sun, or they leave our solar system.\\nthis also raises many questions whether we are safe from the\\nobjects or not; we never know when the next asteroid or comet\\nwill face towards our planet.\\nthe second theory is that in the beginning, there were two\\nsmall-sized planets between mars and jupiter. but the problem\\nwas that somehow their orbits intersected with each other. as\\na result, a massive collision between those planets occurred,\\nforming an asteroid belt. a large amount of debris either fell\\ninto the sun or escaped the solar system after this collision,\\nand only a few hundred thousand objects remained in the\\nasteroid belt.\\njupiter\\nthe fifth planet from the sun is jupiter. jupiter is not only\\nthe biggest planet but also the second biggest object of our\\nsolar system after the sun itself. jupiter has no surface, it is\\nmainly made up of gases. since there is no land on the surface\\nof jupiter, if you try to land your spacecraft on jupiter, it will\\nget sucked towards the centre of jupiter. as your spacecraft\\nwill go down, the heat and pressure will increase. eventually,\\nyour spacecraft will melt before reaching the centre of jupiter,\\nand you will die.\\nit is thought that jupiter might have a solid core mostly made\\nup of metals because of its tremendous pressure. however,\\nwe have no substantial evidence supporting this prediction\\nbecause we cannot go there and look down, it is all gas as far\\nbelow we can see. jupiter has nearly 79 known moons circling\\nit, and most of these moons are very small. jupiter also has\\n114\\nbaby universe\\nsome of the largest moons of our solar system. ganymede\\nwith a diameter of 5,262 kilometres is one of jupiterâ€™s 79\\nmoons; it is even bigger than planet mercury. if ganymede\\nwere not orbiting jupiter, then it would be a planet by itself.\\njupiter is not as cool and calm as we see it in pictures from\\nearth. there are terrible storms on jupiter, which are bigger\\nthan the biggest storm ever seen on earth. one of its storms\\ncan be seen from the surface of the earth. it is known as the\\ngiant red spot, and this storm has been going on for the last\\n200 years. this storm is so violent that the speed of winds can\\nreach over 270 miles per hour.\\nsaturn\\nafter jupiter comes saturn, another gas giant. saturn is the\\nmost beautiful planet to observe through a telescope. it is also\\nthe farthest planet that can be seen from earth with the naked\\neye. saturn is famous for its beautiful rings. these rings are\\nthought to be solid, but they are made up of rocks, ice, and\\nother star dust. it is still not clear how old saturnâ€™s rings are.\\nsaturnâ€™s rings may have been around for 4.5 billion years, which\\nis the beginning of our solar system. another possibility is\\nthat saturn has gained its rings recently by the collision of 2\\nor more of its moons. whenever a moon gets too close to its\\nhost planet, it can be ripped apart by its gravity. that could be\\nanother possibility for the formation of its rings. icy moons\\nsuch as enceladus have been found orbiting saturn so it will\\nnot be surprising if saturn has got its rings by ripping apart\\none of its moons.\\nsaturn is the least dense planet of the solar system with a\\ndensity of 0.68 g/mâ³. if you put saturn in a giant tub of water,\\n115\\nour solar system\\nit would float. saturn has more than 60 known moons orbiting\\naround it, and some moons are the same size as mercury.\\nanother thing that makes saturn interesting is one of its\\nmoons called enceladus. enceladus is a small ocean world\\nfully covered in ice. we cannot see what is below the ice sheet,\\nbut scientists have predicted that there could be vast oceans\\nof water below the ice sheet. scientists are looking forward to\\nsending underwater drones to enceladus and check if it has\\nunderwater aquatic alien life.\\nuranus\\nafter saturn, we have uranus, the seventh planet from the\\nsun. it is a much smaller planet than saturn and jupiter. it\\nis tilted so much about its axis that it seems to be spinning\\nsideways. uranus has small rings around it, much smaller than\\nsaturn. we usually do not see them in the images coming\\nfrom nasa. it is the coldest planet of our solar system where\\nthe lowest temperature can reach -224.2 â„ƒ. since uranus is\\nso distant from the sun, it takes a lot of time to complete one\\norbit around the sun, roughly 84 earth years. with an average\\ndensity of 0.687 g/cm3, it is the second least dense planet.\\nuranus has 27 known moons. uranusâ€™s upper atmosphere is\\ncovered by methane gas, which gives it a beautiful blue colour.\\nwe do not have much information about this gas giant because\\nit has been visited only once by voyager 2.\\nneptune\\nthe eighth and most distant planet from our sun is neptune.\\nneptune is another gas giant with similar compositions as\\nuranus. neptune also has methane in its environment like\\n116\\nbaby universe\\nuranus, giving its blue colour, but it is a darker blue for some\\nreason we are unaware of. neptune has 14 known moons.\\nthe average space between neptune and the sun is around\\n30 astronomical units. neptune takes a very long time to go\\naround the sun, close to 164.8 earth years. most (80%) of\\nneptune consists of hydrogen and helium (19%).\\npluto\\ndiscovered in 1930, pluto used to be listed as the ninth planet\\nof our solar system. however, pluto is too tiny to be considered\\nas a planet, even smaller than many moons we know today.\\nlater, when people started discovering other objects bigger\\nthan pluto and demanded their object to be given the status of\\na planet, pluto was removed from the list of planets. in 2005,\\neris, which is much bigger than pluto, was discovered. in 2006,\\nafter 76 years of being listed as a planet, pluto was declared as\\na dwarf planet. this means that it is like a planet but too small\\nto be called a planet in our solar system. there are at least\\nfive known official dwarf planets in the solar system discovered\\nafter pluto, and there could possibly be many more. pluto takes\\n248 years to complete one revolution around the sun.\\nkuiper belt\\nthe kuiper belt is a circumstellar disc located in our outer\\nsolar system. it is very similar to the asteroid belt but is much\\nmore massive and broader. it contains several more objects as\\ncompared to the asteroid belt. for us, this place is not only\\nmysterious but also very cold and dark. the kuiper belt is\\nsmaller than the oort cloud, but it is still one of our solar\\nsystemâ€™s most massive structures. since this region is so far, the\\n117\\nour solar system\\nsunâ€™s heat and light does not reach there effectively. as a result,\\nboth the oort cloud and the kuiper belt are thought to be the\\nsources of comets that we receive in our solar system.\\nastronomers believe that the icy objects, mostly comets of\\nthe kuiper belt, are remnants of the solar systemâ€™s formation.\\nif neptune did not exist with its gravitational influence, the\\nkuiper belt might have formed a planet. that way we would\\nhave nine planets in our solar system right now. however,\\nneptuneâ€™s gravity has stirred up this region and prevented\\nthem from forming a new planet.\\noort cloud\\noort cloud is basically a shell of icy objects located in the\\noutermost region of our solar system. oort cloud surrounds the\\nsun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 astronomical\\nunits. some astronomers believe that oort cloud has not\\nexisted there forever. instead, our sun might have captured the\\nmaterial of oort cloud from the outer disks of other stars\\nforming in our nebula.\\n118\\nbaby universe\\nit is hard to study oort cloud because of its distance from\\nthe sun. however, it is predicted that it contains more than 2\\ntrillion icy objects, comets and asteroids. in a way, oort cloud\\ncompletes our solar system. it gives us a boundary to which we\\ncan look and say that this is how big our solar system is. since\\nit is way too far and way too complicated, astronomers are yet\\nto study most of its bigger objects and predict their trajectory\\naround the sun.\\nsolar system cam can be differentiated as an inner and outer\\nsolar system depending upon our position in it. the first four\\nplanets including mercury, venus, earth, and mars, are the\\ninner planets composed of rock and metal. the massive planets\\njupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune are the gas giants mainly\\ncomposed of hydrogen and helium, and are also called the\\nouter planets. mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, saturn are our\\nnearest planets, and in a clear night sky, all of them can be\\nviewed with the naked eye.\\n119\\nour solar system\\n120\\nbaby universe\\npa r t i i i\\nour planet\\n121\\nearthâ€™s story\\nevery single planet in the solar system has its own story, and earth is one of them. to understand earthâ€™s story, we must follow the tracks left behind since the beginning of our planet. even though the early solar systemâ€™s dramatic conditions have destroyed almost all the evidence, a few of them are still here. the earliest rocks give us the fingerprints of volcanic activity that occurred in the beginning and the transitions our planet has gone through. geologists hunt for such rocks to reveal the baby picture of the earth and how it looked back then. at the beginning of the solar system, a large number of planets were born. some planets destroyed themselves and others as well, some kept on growing by adding more mass to their pile. as smaller planets came into their path, they became their moons. in our case, jupiter has over 79 known moons; most of them were captured by its gravity.\\nwhen earth had just begun forming 4.5 billion years ago, it was in a molten state. there used to be nothing except the oceans of lava. at that time, if you stood on earth, you would get submerged in lava and die instantly due to the heat. earth was getting bombarded by a large number (millions) of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids every day. that was one of the reasons preventing earth from cooling down quickly. because of this molten state of earth, most of the heavier elements such as\\n122\\nbaby universe\\niron, steel, gold (most of the metals) moved towards the centre.\\neven today, the majority of metals are stored in the very core\\nof our planet.\\nat the same time, lighter elements such as clay, sand, etc.,\\nstayed at the top of earth, which we commonly see everywhere\\non the ground. the moving of elements due to earthâ€™s molten\\nstate is the reason why we have a solid core made up of heavy\\nelements. today, the temperature at the boundary of earthâ€™s\\ninner and outer core is estimated to be 6,000 degrees celsius,\\nequal to the sunâ€™s surface. one of the big reasons our planetâ€™s\\ncore is still hot is that it is surrounded by a vast amount of sand\\nand clay, and secondly, it is made up of heavy metals. a long\\ntime after the earthâ€™s formation, its surface was still like a giant\\nball of lava orbiting around a newly born star, sun. there was\\nno sign of life since the ordinary temperature was over 1000\\ndegrees celsius.\\nthe vacuum of space is cold, its temperature is near absolute\\nzero, -273.15 degrees celsius. the vacuum of space was cold\\nenough to make earth cool down. as soon as our planet\\nstarted cooling down, it began from the outer surface, the same\\nsurface that we stand on today. it took more than 1 million\\nyears for earth to become cold enough to cover its surface\\nwith solid lava. rocks of that time are very hard to find today,\\nso geologists generally use meteoroids and date them to get\\nearthâ€™s actual age. meteoroids can be found on earth, and they\\ntell us that earth is over 4.5 billion years old.\\n123\\nearthâ€™s story\\nthis is how earth looked like 4.5 billion years ago.\\nearth changed slowly. after millions of years of formation, the\\nscene was different. our planet was not as hot as it is today, and\\nit had started to take shape and form. as the surface cooled,\\nall the lava oceans turned into hard surfaces. even though it\\nmight have seemed that our planet was calm from outside,\\na lot of volcanic activity was still happening there. millions\\nof volcanoes erupted, sending tons of dust, gases, and mainly\\nco2 into the atmosphere. even after 100 million years of its\\nformation, earth was not suitable to support life. now that\\nearth had a solid surface, volcanic activity was also slowing\\ndown with time, but there was one more ingredient that our\\nplanet needed to harbour life, water.\\nhow did earth acquire water?\\nfor many scientists, it is still a mystery how earth acquired all\\nof its water, but some scientists believe that they have found\\nan answer. the answer to this question lies in the meteoroids.\\n124\\nbaby universe\\nwhen scientists studied the meteoroids falling on earth from\\nouter space, they discovered small droplets of liquid water\\nin them. it is believed that as the universe cooled down, the\\nwater present in meteoroids became ice and stayed there in\\nouter space. meteoroids that collided with our planet brought\\nwater with them. millions of meteoroids were colliding with\\nour planet every day, adding water to earth drop by drop.\\nthis fundamental idea comes from the scientific observations\\nexplaining how water came from outer space.\\nit seems impossible to believe that small meteoroids can bring\\nso much water to our planet and fill a large number of oceans.\\nhowever, it looks possible when the bombarding of meteoroids\\noccurs for millions of years. we are lucky that the water did\\nnot cover our entire planet. 3/4th of our planet is underwater,\\nwhereas the other is solid land where we build our homes and\\nlive with our families. if too many meteoroids had hit earth\\ncovering the entire planet with water, there would be no sign of\\nus today. only aquatic life would be thriving on a blue planet.\\nevery drop of water that we have on earth is billions of years\\nold. it is possible that the water we drink today might have\\ntravelled billions of kilometres in space to reach our planet\\ninside a meteoroid. this reminds us of how lucky we are to be\\nborn and have a life on this planet. i hope this fills you with\\ngratitude for mother earth as well.\\nearth spins at about 1000 miles an hour at the equator, but this\\nnumber was much higher in the beginning. not only was our\\nplanet spinning faster, but the moon was also very close to the\\nsurface. today we see tides on our oceans due to the impact\\nof the moonâ€™s gravity, but when the moon was much closer,\\nand earth was spinning faster, the moon used to create huge\\n125\\nearthâ€™s story\\ntides, probably 100 meters or more in height. as time passed,\\nearthâ€™s rotation slowed down, the moon moved away from\\nus, and the waves calmed down. after 700 million years of the\\nformation of earth, life-giving water covered its surface. the\\nlava busted over the oceans and cooled down quickly resulting\\nin the formation of small islands. in the future, these islands\\nwill join to form continents.\\nvolcanic activity filled earthâ€™s atmosphere with carbon dioxide.\\nnitrogen gas makes up 78 percent of the air we breathe, and it\\nis thought that most of the nitrogen was trapped in primordial\\nrubble that formed the earth. when they smashed together,\\nnitrogen was released. once the earth was covered with water\\nand land was emerging through the volcano, one more crucial\\nthing required for the growth of life was left, an oxygen-rich\\natmosphere. where did the oxygen come from?\\nevery minute we inhale and exhale several gases 20 times.\\nabout 21% of that gas is oxygen. early earth had none of the\\noxygen that we inhale today. the atmosphere was poisonous for\\nlife. a substantial volcanic activity filled earthâ€™s environment\\nwith a mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and\\neven some amount of sulfuric acid. we humans will not be\\nable to stand even a minute over a surface with such a hostile\\nenvironment. however, as we know, life does exist. so how did\\nit happen?\\na one-word answer is, stromatolites. stromatolites made it\\npossible for earth to contain such a large amount of oxygen in\\nan environment where there were nothing but poisonous gases.\\nstromatolites are found underwater, they contain microbes\\ncalled cyanobacteria. even a small piece of stromatolite may\\n126\\nbaby universe\\nhave millions of cyanobacteria present in it. what makes\\nthese cyanobacteria unique is that they can produce oxygen.\\ncyanobacteria changed the history of earth with their ability\\nto produce oxygen. the process of cyanobacteria producing\\noxygen is very slow, so it took another millions of years of\\ncontinuous pumping to fill earthâ€™s atmosphere with oxygen.\\nif we go close to a cyanobacteria underwater, we can see it\\nforming bubbles of oxygen and eventually releasing them into\\nthe air. they take water and sunlight to produce oxygen. life\\nevolved and grew under the atmosphere that cyanobacteria\\nmade. stromatolites can be seen even today in the depth\\nof the oceans and where the water has evaporated. living\\nstromatolites are very rare to find on the earth. stromatolites\\nare the example of how microbial life dominated early earth.\\nwithout stromatolites and cyanobacteria, earthâ€™s geology\\nwould be very different. water and a toxic environment would\\nbe there, but you and i would not.\\n127\\nearthâ€™s story\\nstory of life\\nin the beginning, life was not as sophisticated as we see it today.\\nit was simpler. life started as a single cell, or it can be said that\\nit started all alone. single cells acted as the most prestigious\\nbuilding blocks of life. humanity came into existence just\\n200,000 years ago, but the building blocks that lead to this\\nare working for billions of years. so, what is there that makes\\nus humans? what is the meaning of intelligence, and how\\ndid it originate? is it possible for life to have intelligence and\\nconsciousness in some other forms of matter at some other part\\nof the universe? to know these answers, we must understand\\nthe journey of our planet because the journey of earth is\\nsomehow the journey of humanity towards consciousness. it is\\na journey where some part of the matter is going to look back\\ntowards its own origin. it is a journey where the universe gives\\nbirth to itself and can understand itself.\\nafter the big bang explosion and the formation of the universe,\\nthe origin of life was the second most significant thing that\\nhappened. the journey of life on earth is just as complex as the\\njourney of the formation of the universe. from being nothing\\nbut some chemicals to becoming a single cell organism and\\neventually becoming such a complex machine that we are one\\nof the greatest subjects to study. when we look at the human\\nbody, the most complex structure we have is the human brain.\\nthe way it handles several emotions and the way it perceives\\nvarious senses, such as the sense of touch, smell, vision, hearing\\nand taste is magical. medical science, to this day, is trying to\\nunderstand how the human brain works. in short, the brain is\\nthe place where you exist. you can ask yourself, who am i? but\\n128\\nbaby universe\\neven the answer lies within the brain itself. our brainâ€™s ability\\nto question itself has given us tremendous powers over other\\nspecies.\\nwe have a vivid sense of memory that helps us remember what\\nhappened years ago and still feel the same emotions. not just\\nthe past, our brain can simulate what will happen in the future.\\nit can imagine things that have never happened or will never\\nhappen. even though sometimes it can give us anxiety, but that\\nis something that makes us humans. it has been estimated that\\nour brain can perform over 10,000,000,000,000,000 operations\\nper second, and we never notice it.\\nbeing a physics lover, talking to my mom is the ability of a\\ncondensed matter to interact with some other part of the same\\nmatter. but why is this limited to living organisms only, why\\ncanâ€™t rocks interact with each other. well, they do not carry\\nsomething which we do. the matter we consist of obeys some\\nspecific quantum laws, whereas the rocks do not. as far as we\\nknow, planet earth is the only liveable place in the universe; it\\nis the only planet we know that supports life! we have found\\nmany planets orbiting in the goldilocks zone, but we have\\nnot found the signs of intelligence there yet. early evolution\\nwas the period when life originated and grew in the lap of the\\nsea, and after a specific interval of time, it finally came out of\\nwater. to understand the spark of life, we must understand the\\nevolution of our planet but with reference to life.\\nin the beginning, life was in the form of single cells, or it can\\nbe said that all the bricks required to build complex structures\\nwere starting to evolve. moreover, when they came together,\\nthe earthâ€™s atmosphere and the surrounding environment\\n129\\nearthâ€™s story\\ncemented for those building blocks to stay arranged and evolve\\nfurther to form more complex structures. the contribution of\\nour sun also cannot be forgotten; if earth worked as a backbone\\nfor life to stand, then sun acted as the primary source of food\\nfor life to nourish. whenever life seemed to be in danger, it\\nwas the nearby environment that acted as a sword to protect it.\\nafter 700 million years of earthâ€™s formation, the life-giving\\nwater covered its surface, and tiny islands appeared. meteoroids\\nthat hit earth and covered its surface with water also came\\nwith one more crucial thing, minerals. as the meteoroids\\ndissolved, they released their minerals into the ocean water\\nand transported carbon, proteins, and amino acids from outer\\nspace to the bottom of the oceans of earth. these minerals\\nwere necessary for the formation of single-cell organisms, so\\nwe must be thankful to these meteoroids.\\namino acids are the building blocks of life, they are present\\nin each living organism. these amino acids can be found in\\nthe meteoroids that enter earthâ€™s environment. this is one of\\nthe most significant discoveries ever made, explaining how life\\ngrew in the very early ages and how it was supported by the\\namino acids taken to the earth by the meteoroids. meteoroids\\ncame with water, amino acids, and metals. most of the\\ningredients we see today in the lap of nature are taken by these\\nmeteoroids billions of years ago. how did these meteoroids\\nget these minerals? the meteoroid got the minerals from some\\nearly supernova explosions that occurred shortly after the big\\nbang.\\nthree hundred meters under the earthâ€™s surface, it is entirely\\ndark. sunâ€™s radiation cannot reach there, and it is nearly\\n130\\nbaby universe\\nfreezing. all the minerals that meteoroids brought in created\\na chemical soup, and somehow these chemicals came together\\nto create life! they formed the single-celled bacteria that are\\nconsidered as the earliest form of life on earth. this was the\\ndefining moment for the formation of life; the microscopic\\nlife was on its way. this is how life originated and spread its\\nvery first fragrance underwater. from this soup of chemicals,\\nvarious kinds of bacteria came into existence, and one of them\\nwas cyanobacteria, who filled earthâ€™s atmosphere with oxygen.\\n3.5 billion years ago, life was growing in the seabeds in the\\nform of small mountains called stromatolitesâ€”each consisting\\nof a large number of bacteria, usually cyanobacteria. over time\\nthese bacteria learned to turn sunlight directly into food by a\\nprocess we call photosynthesis. these bacteria used sunlight,\\ncarbon dioxide and water, and turned it into glucose, a simple\\nform of sugar. this magical transformation released the lifegiving\\ngas, oxygen, as a by-product. underwater these bacteria\\nfilled oceans with oxygen, and most of this oxygen was\\nreleased into the outer environment.\\n131\\nthe moon\\nif we look at the entire human history, the object which has had the most profound impact on human lives is the moon. from the tales of grandmothers to the rising tides of oceans, the moon has always impacted our lives. when i was a child, my mother used to tell us many tales about the moon and called it â€˜uncle moon.â€™ little did i know that what i am calling â€˜uncleâ€™ is nothing but a large and dense piece of matter circling earth. in the future, whenever humanity will talk about the history of space exploration, the one thing they will talk in common about will be our moon.\\nearth is unique because it has a special moon, which is also the brightest object in the sky after the sun. the story cannot be completed without taking the moon into account. since its birth about 4.51 billion years ago, the moon has influenced earth and the lives of its beings. the moon not only influences living systems but non-living systems too.\\njust like any other relationship, the earth-moon relationship is also theatrical. the distance of the moon from earth has not always been the same as it is today, it has changed over time. since its birth, the moon has been slowly slipping away from our planetâ€™s gravitational grasp. the rate at which the moon is getting away from us currently is roughly 3.82 cm per year. however, this rate has not been constant since the birth of\\n132\\nbaby universe\\nthe moon, and it will not be constant in the future. moon\\norbits, on average, 384,400 kilometres from earth; if you blast\\na torch towards the moon from earth, it would take about\\n1.28 seconds for light to reach the moon. with a diameter\\nof about 3,474.2 km, the moon is the biggest natural satellite\\nrevolving around earth. the moon is not only the fifth largest\\nbut also the second most dense natural satellite after jupiterâ€™s\\nio in our solar system.\\nmoon is tidally locked with the earth. which means it shows\\nonly one side to earth. the force of gravity between the earth\\nand moon causes some fascinating effects. the most obvious\\nis the tides. moonâ€™s gravitational attraction is maximum to\\nthe side of earth closer to the moon and minimum on the\\nopposite side. this effect of the moonâ€™s gravity can be seen over\\nthe seas of earth. not being perfectly rigid, the earthâ€™s oceans\\nare stretched out along the line towards the moon; in the same\\nway, the sunâ€™s gravity also does its work, and as a result, we\\n133\\nthe moon\\nsee two little bulges. one towards the moon and one directly\\nopposite and towards the sun, as shown in the picture. this\\ngravitational effect is much more influential on ocean water\\nthan on solid crust. since earth rotates much faster than the\\nmoon, the bulges move around the earth once a day, giving\\ntwo high tides per day.\\nthere are many predictions describing the origin of our moon,\\nbut we are still trying to know the real truth behind them.\\nthere are four major theories/hypotheses describing the origin\\nof the moon. these are:\\n1. sister theory\\n2. the capture theory\\n3. the daughter or fission theory\\n4. impact theory â€“ the most accepted theory\\n134\\nbaby universe\\n1. sister theory\\nsister theory suggests that during the formation of our solar\\nsystem, the moon formed as a separate object near earth. the\\nformation of earth and the moon took place at the same time.\\nthe material that formed earth also gave birth to the moon.\\nas a result, in the beginning, we had two planets, one bigger\\n(earth) and the other smaller (moon), and it was a â€˜double\\nplanet system.â€™ however, there was a problem with this system,\\nearth took out more material from the raw disk of the solar\\nsystem and acquired more mass, whereas the moon could\\nnot do so and stayed small. after the formation of these two\\nplanets, as earth was bigger, it had more gravitational force.\\nso, earthâ€™s gravity attracted the moon, and it ended up falling\\ninto an orbit around earth.\\nflaw in the sister theory\\neven though this theory seems very satisfying, there is a\\nsignificant flaw in it. the problem revolves around the density\\nand composition of earth and the moon. when scientists\\nstudied the density of earth and the moon, they found it to\\nbe different. earthâ€™s density is around 5.5 g/cmâ³, whereas the\\nmoonâ€™s density is around 3.3 g/cmâ³, which is way too different.\\nif earth and moon had formed as a double planet system\\nand they formed side by side from the same interplanetary\\nmaterial, their density must be the same. the essential physical\\ncharacteristics of the moon, such as the density, does not allow\\nus to say that both originated together.\\n2. capture theory\\nnow, as we know that earth and moon density are not\\n135\\nthe moon\\nsimilar, that must mean the moon was not formed anywhere\\nnear earth. this is precisely what capture theory suggests.\\naccording to this theory, the moon was formed far away from\\nearth, somewhere outside the orbit of our planet. however,\\nthe problem was that it did not have a stable orbit to revolve\\naround the sun. as a result, the sunâ€™s gravity pulled the\\nmoon towards itself, and the moon started falling into the\\nsun. while the moon was moving towards the sun, it passed\\nnear earth and got captured. since then, the moon has been\\norbiting earth. if there were no earth, then the moon would\\nhave either fallen into the sun or would have collided with\\nmercury or venus in the way.\\nflaw in the capture theory\\nthe main problem with capture theory is the abnormal mass\\nof our moon. for us, earth might seem like a big planet, but in\\nthe scale of the solar system, it is tiny. if the moon was formed\\naway from the earth, it must have a very high momentum\\nwhile passing near earth, making it hard to capture for our\\nsmall-sized planet. this way, either moon would have escaped\\nearthâ€™s gravity or would have destroyed earth with a huge\\nimpact. there are many chances for a big object like our moon\\nto alter the stable orbit of earth if moving with considerable\\nmomentum. as a result, it would have caused both earth\\nand the moon to fall into the sun together. the computer\\nsimulations done to check this theoryâ€™s credibility show that\\nsuch a capture would be physically impossible due to the\\nmoonâ€™s high mass.\\n3. daughter or fission theory\\n136\\nbaby universe\\nthis theory suggests that the moon is the daughter of earth,\\nand it originated from earth itself. as we know, during its\\nformation, earth used to spin at an immense speed. this speed\\nslowed down with time, but it is still spinning at the rate of\\n1,000 miles per hour on the equator. according to the fission\\ntheory, due to the fast spinning, a large portion of earth was\\nexpelled out of it. however, that expelled matter did not leave\\nearthâ€™s orbit and fall into the sun, and instead started orbiting\\nour planet. as time passed, that orbiting matter started colliding\\nwith space debris and became bigger and bigger. after millions\\nof years of collisions, all that matter came together and formed\\nour moon.\\nflaw in the capture theory\\nfission theory has the same major flaw as the sister theory.\\nboth the earth and moon have different compositions. moon\\nmight have the same composition of some essential ingredients\\nas we see on earth. but the overall density is not the same as\\nearth, which becomes a big reason for the failure of capture\\ntheory.\\n4. impact theory\\nimpact theory suggests that the moon was formed by the\\ncollision of a mars-size planet named theia with earth. theia\\nwas about the size of mars, with a diameter of about 6,102 km\\n(3,792 miles). according to impact theory, at the beginning\\nof the solar system, a planet named theia formed in our solar\\nsystem. evidence published in the year 2019 suggests that\\ntheia might have formed in the outer solar system rather\\nthan the inner solar system. since theia did not have a stable\\n137\\nthe moon\\norbit, it was pulled towards the sun. while on its way to fall\\ninto the sun, a small part of it collided with earth. such types\\nof collisions were prevalent in the early solar system.\\nit was not a direct face to face impact; both planets touched each\\nother and continued moving on their path. this impact was so\\nhorrible that millions of tons of matter acquired the escape\\nvelocity and escaped into outer space, while the rest stayed in\\norbit around earth. the impact increased the spinning rate of\\nearth; a day took just six hours for completion. this collision\\nresulted in the formation of a lava belt around earth. as time\\npassed, the lava belt assembled, resulting in the formation of\\ntwo moons around earth. however, there was a problem with\\nthe velocities of these two newly formed moons; they did not\\nhave the same velocity in the same orbit, which means one more\\nimpact. both the moons collided with each other, resulting\\nin a single moon around earth. the computer simulations\\nprimarily support this theory. computer modelling provides\\nus the evidence for the possibility of the above scenario and\\nfurther proves this theory.\\n138\\nbaby universe\\nevidences of modern impact theory\\nin the beginning, earth was a super-hot ball of magma due\\nto which most of the heavy metals moved into the core. thea\\ncollided with the outer part of the earth, and there was no\\neffect on earthâ€™s inner core. the primary physical evidence\\ncame in the form of rocks brought back to earth by the apollo\\nmissions. on examination, it was found that the rock contained\\na meagre amount of iron. as expected, it proves the idea that\\nthe moon may have been formed from the outer portion of\\nearthâ€™s surface, which got into orbit after collision with theia.\\nanother evidence is that the samples brought back to earth\\nfrom the moon indicates that the moonâ€™s surface was once\\nmolten. but over time, it cooled down and became solid rock.\\n139\\nour evolving world\\nlife was easy, i used to know all the answers, and then i learned cosmology.\\nwhen i was a child, we did not have an ac or cooling devices, so our family used to sleep at the rooftop like most other people in our village during the summertime. the sky used to be very clear with many distant twinkling stars. my mother used to tell me that all these twinkling stars are our relatives. when people die, they become a star in the sky. my mother used to point out different stars and tell us, â€˜this star is your grandmother, and all the rest are other relatives.â€™ in my village, people believed that earth was supported by the horn of a cow, and earthquakes occurred when the cow shifted earth from one horn to another.\\nmy parents used to force me to pray to god every day, which i had to. i used to ask for good marks from god, but i never got them. this could mean two things: either god does not exist, or maybe god was not happy with the way i was praying. for me, like all my family, there used to be someone in the sky who created us and controlled everything. lightning used to mean that god was angry, and rain used to mean that god was happy with our prayers. the term â€˜godâ€™ also used to apply to multiple beings based on their abilities and power, and our destiny used to be either heaven or hell, depending upon the\\n140\\nbaby universe\\nrole we play on earth.\\nall of us have experienced different stories like mine throughout\\nour childhood, but all of them have one thing in common,\\nour stories point to someone in the sky. but does that hold\\ntrue? our world is limited, but the universe is beyond those\\nlimitations. our picture of the universe is personal and changes\\ndepending upon our religion and understanding. the meaning\\nof the moon and distant twinkling stars differ depending on\\nthe teachings they have received. most people believe there is\\nsomeone who created the universe, but he does not allow us to\\nask who created him.\\ntoday our view of the universe is evolving rapidly, proving our\\nchildhood stories to be wrong. this is not the failure of our\\ngrandmothers, this is the failure of religion. religion cannot\\nprove science wrong, but science can do that to religion.\\nreligion restricts us and confines us within a box, but science\\nhas no restrictions. religion has boundaries, science is beyond\\nthese limitations. it shatters my heart to know that all the tales\\ntold by my grandmother about the moon and stars are mere\\nfiction. simultaneously, we should not forget that science has\\nproved itself wrong time and time again and has gone through\\na continuous evolution. we know that our understanding of\\ngravity and time might change entirely in the next 100 years.\\nso, we should not hold our grandmothers accountable. she did\\nthe best of what she knew.\\nnot only god, but we have also created the different demons\\nfor ourselves. however, all that was necessary because it\\nprovided us with an initial view of the universe. it has provided\\nus a base upon which we can build and further improve our\\n141\\nour evolving world\\nunderstanding by looking deeper into space.\\nearlier, when horses were used to travel long distances, the\\nmeaning of life was different, and the purpose of life was\\nconfined within boundaries. getting our basic needs completed\\nwas sufficient. cosmology has opened infinite doors for us\\neven while talking about god. cosmology has shown us that\\nthere is no heaven and hell up there above the clouds, except\\nsome asteroids and meteoroids. sometimes i wonder where\\nprecisely the heavens are. a man standing on the north pole\\nof earth would look up and pray, whereas a man standing on\\nthe south pole would also look up and pray. in this scenario,\\nboth men are looking at opposite directions, so where are the\\nheavens exactly. we will talk about god in detail later.\\nour enlightened world is the direct evidence of our\\nachievements in science; cosmology has provided us a broad\\nview. the invention of the telescope was a milestone in this\\nrace. the previous telescopes were not as good as the ones\\nwe have today, but they opened many ways for us to explore\\nthe universe. everything we know about the universe today is\\nbecause of the invention of telescopes.\\nresearch organizations like national aeronautics and space\\nadministration (nasa), russian federal space agency\\n(roscosmos), european space agency (esa), indian\\nspace research organization (isro) are some of the\\nonlookers who give us the experimental evidences over the\\ntheoretical proofs. which further changes what we know\\nabout the universe.\\nwe must understand a few things which are noteworthy about\\nthis fast-changing world.\\n142\\nbaby universe\\n1. the next 100 years\\n2. hubble space telescope\\n3. large hadron collider\\nthe next 100 years\\nthe coming 100 years are going to be the most crucial time\\nof the entire human history. what we will do in the next 100\\nyears may or may not decide our place in the universe, but it will\\nensure whether humanity survives in the universe. according\\nto frank drakeâ€™s equation, 10,000 years is the estimated\\nlifetime of any technical civilization. if we make it through\\nthe next 100 years, the possibility of us making through the\\nnext 10,000 years will increase dramatically. thinking about\\nthe next 100 years gives us a rough picture of how science will\\nshape our world into a better one.\\ntoday we are developing at a faster and faster pace. just imagine\\nwhere the world was 50 years ago. those massive computers\\nthat not everyone could afford. those big mobile phones that\\nonly the rich used to contact other rich people. in just the last\\n50 years, we have taken a significant leap in technology and\\nscience. if you go back 50 years and say that 50 years from now,\\nyou would have thousands of times of technological capability\\nin your pocket than these giant computers, no one would\\nhave believed you. today we have smartphones with those\\ncapabilities. our smartphone is thousands of times faster and\\ncapable than the computers used by nasa to put a man on\\nthe moon in 1969.\\nwith the help of science, we have shaped our giant computers\\ninto small laptops. our large 50-kilogram tvs have become\\n143\\nour evolving world\\nlcds, we have shaped our large telephones into small\\nsmartphones. i am not sure whether we would be able to design\\nairplanes using the principle of anti - gravitation. however, i\\nam sure that with this speed of continuous evolution, we would\\nbe able to transform ourselves into a type-1 civilization in the\\nnext 100 to 200 years.\\nso, how would the year 2100 look like? what technological\\nadvancements would we have then? how would normal life\\nfunction with the use of technology? let us have a closer look:\\n1. future of artificial intelligence: there is no doubt that\\nartificial intelligence is our future. the ability of ai to learn any\\ntask by doing it repeatedly is something that makes it unique.\\nai will open many doors for us and take control over things we\\nstruggle with in our daily lives. the ability of ordinary matter\\nto acquire such intelligence without having any consciousness\\nis something beyond this world, but we have already made it\\nhappen. today, ai can manage a home; mark zuckerberg took\\none year to develop an ai capable of handling most things at\\nhis home. it can turn off the lights, play the music, entertain\\nthe kids and many other things. it cannot assemble its parts\\ninto an iron man as mr. stark did in the movie; it is limited to\\nthe screens only. we can hope that one day ai would be able\\nto do that as well. future ai will be smarter, you will not need\\nto pay your chef and gardener their salaries, ai would handle\\nthat. you will not even have to drive your car because it would\\nbe able to take full control of your car and drop you at your\\ndestination.\\nsome people fear that ai will take over humans and rule\\nthis planet. well, i do not think humans are dumb enough to\\n144\\nbaby universe\\nbuild a machine that will have the capacity to take over their\\nlives and make them do whatever it wants. we would like to\\ndevelop it but at the same time make sure it does not cause any\\nharm. the harmful use of ai would be people or governments\\nusing it against each other. some people fear that ai will take\\nover their jobs, and they would have no work to do. this is a\\ngrave and genuine concern. however, as we are developing in\\nterms of technology, our means of generating revenue is also\\nchanging. now more and more people are working sitting on\\na chair compared to those doing physical work. who knows,\\nmaybe the stock market and crypto will become a new currency,\\nand we would not have to do anything at all. only time will\\ntell.\\n2. control of mind over matter: no matter how advanced\\nartificial intelligence becomes, it will always have some\\nlimitations; after all, it is artificial. due to the evolution of\\nmillions of years, the human brain is beyond those limitations.\\nour intelligence is beyond the limits of artificial intelligence.\\nonce we are done with ai, we would start looking at the\\npossibilities of the human brain gaining control over matter.\\nusing small chips implanted in the human brain, we would be\\nable to gain control of all the things around us. scientists are\\nnot sure how we have such a sophisticated brain.\\nwhat kind of brain you have determines how you experience\\nthe world? brain of an average human weighs around 3 pounds\\nand contains more than 100 billion neurons. neurons are the\\ncells that carry information from one place to another. having\\na cell phone in our hands enhances our capability to a large\\nextent. we can reach out to anyone anywhere in the world.\\nimagine what wonders a human would do with enhanced brain\\n145\\nour evolving world\\ncapabilities. by implanting a chip in your brain, you would be\\nable to do most of your tasks by just thinking about it.\\nright now, if you want to go somewhere, you tell the driver\\nyour destination. when ai comes, it will drive your car, but\\nyou still have to tell it where to go by inputting the destination.\\nhowever, by implanting a chip in your head, you would not\\nneed to tell anyone anything. just sit in the car and think about\\ngiving instructions to your car and it will take you there. the\\nsame chip will control not only the car but most of the things\\nof your daily life. your tv will start, your pizza will be ordered\\nto your location, and you would be able to shop for any item\\nfrom any store just by thinking about it. you will be able to\\ncontact anyone anytime just by using your brain. there will be\\nno need to carry a 6 inch smartphone.\\n3. space travel: space travel opens the door of new possibilities\\nand a new future. over time, the speed of space exploration\\nwill be boosted. i am not sure that we would be able to use\\nwormholes or warp drives to travel vast distances till 2100, but\\nwe can hope for the same in the future. in 1000 years from\\nnow, future space shuttles will use the power of stars to power\\nthemselves. these giant ships would then take us anywhere in\\nthe solar system with a speed close to that of light. we would\\nbe able to harness the energy of space itself to travel vast\\ndistances. the future spaceships would work with the power\\nof an atom; they will use nuclear reactors to power themselves\\nup. our current thrusters will become old enough to put in a\\nmuseum by then.\\n4. computers: in the late 20th century, having a cell phone\\nused to be a sign of wealth and well-being. when steve jobs\\n146\\nbaby universe\\nannounced an ipod with 1000 songs in your pocket in 2001,\\npeople went crazy. they had seen nothing like that. in less\\nthan 20 years, everyone is holding a smartphone with access to\\nunlimited songs through the internet. that is how rapidly our\\nworld is changing. in the beginning, computers used to weigh\\nmultiple tons, it used to take an entire team to operate them.\\ndoing some small calculations that we can now do in our\\ncalculators was the best use of computers. today our phones\\nhave a much better computing power than the computer used\\nby nasa in 1969 while landing the first man on the surface of\\nthe moon. today all those computers are a part of museums.\\ni am sure that until 2100, todayâ€™s laptops and computers will\\nbecome a part of museums as well. you would no longer need\\nto carry a smartphone and a 2-3 kg laptop in your backpack.\\nusing the chip implanted in your brain, you would be able to\\nturn any piece of paper into a computer and do the work that\\nyou usually do. that chip will also store the data for further\\nuse. the difference between a smartphone and a computer will\\ncome down to nothing.\\n5. civilization: till 2100, we can hope that our civilization will\\ntransform into a type-1 civilizationâ€”a planetary civilization\\nwith no boundaries. we will talk about it later.\\n6. colonies on the moon: by 2100, we will have colonies on the\\nmoon. our colonies will include many dome-like structures\\nto protect the astronauts or engineers up there from solar\\nradiation and to provide them with a comfortable atmosphere.\\nthe moon has no atmosphere, and it is very calm. the only\\nthing we would need to take care of is the food, water, air and\\nsolar radiations. colonies on the moon would become a big\\n147\\nour evolving world\\ntourist attraction. people from different countries would be\\nable to sign up for the moon tour. a rocket from earth will\\ntake them directly there. in general, there will be two types of\\ntourists on the moon. one who will land on the surface and\\nexplore everything, and those who will fly by the moon and\\nreturn to earth. this will become normal. only the wealthy\\npeople would be able to afford the moon tour. rockets that\\nwill take you there are costly, so a ticket to the moon will be\\nvery costly. an entire tourism industry for tourism in earthâ€™s\\norbit and the moon will get established.\\nwhat will be the use of the moonbase?\\na base on the moon can be used for many things. firstly, we\\ncan build a giant telescope on the far side of the moon and\\nobserve the universe at our will. nasa is already planning\\nto do so, but no physical work is done so far. our moonbase\\nwill also serve as the base for travel to mars. when rockets\\ntake off from earth, they burn most of their energy trying\\nto get out of the earthâ€™s atmosphere by acquiring the escape\\nvelocity. by having a base on the moon, we would not have to\\nwaste that much energy. also, the escape velocity of the moon\\nis significantly low. so, we would not waste much fuel in the\\nbeginning. if we want to land on the surface of mars and then\\nalso be able to return home, we need rockets with lots of fuel,\\nnot only to travel to mars but also to leave its atmosphere later.\\nthus, the moonbase will serve as a good launching point. it\\nis predicted that the first person to step foot on mars would\\nbe a female. nothing else could be more empowering for the\\ngenerations of females.\\n148\\nbaby universe\\nhubble space telescope\\nsince the beginning, humanity has looked up at the stars\\nand have wondered about their place in the universe. in the\\nbeginning, we were dependent upon our eyes, and all we knew\\ncame from observations made via the naked eye. once we\\nstarted looking deeper into the universe, having a telescope on\\nthe ground was not enough. ground telescopes can observe\\nnearby stars and galaxies, but they tend to produce blurry\\nimages and are not useful for looking at distant space objects.\\nas light from distant stars and galaxies enters our atmosphere,\\nit gets distorted by the variation in temperature and density of\\nour environment.\\nthe presence of vast amounts of dust and other impurities further\\nlowers the quality of the image. we see the stars twinkling\\nat night not because they are twinkling but because the light\\ncoming from them has to pass through our atmosphere before\\nreaching our eyes. if you go outside the atmosphere and look\\nat those same stars, they would not be twinkling and would\\ninstead look brighter and shinier. another problem groundbased\\ntelescopes encounter is that the atmosphere blocks/\\nabsorbs specific wavelengths of radiation like ultraviolet,\\ngamma and x-rays before they can reach the telescope.\\nclearly, ground-based telescopes are not fully efficient. so, to\\nsolve this problem, the idea of a telescope in space orbiting\\nearth was put forward by hermann oberth in the year 1923.\\nby being outside earthâ€™s environment, this telescope would be\\nable to get better images and other scientific data. a telescope\\noutside the earthâ€™s environment is the right and only solution\\nto the problem that ground-based telescopes must face every\\n149\\nour evolving world\\nday. on april 24th, 1990, a telescope named â€˜hubbleâ€™ was\\nlaunched from kennedy launch centre.\\nlaunch of the hubble telescope was the beginning of a new\\nera in space exploration. now we were able to see distant stars,\\nclusters, galaxies, and other objects in space with more accuracy\\nthan ever. hubble was one of the most/first significant scientific\\ninstruments placed in space until 1990. scientists have used\\nhubble to observe some of the most distant planets, stars, and\\ngalaxies of the universe. not just outside space, scientists have\\nalso used the telescope to study our solar system.\\nthe hubble telescope has a length of roughly 13.25 meters\\nor 43.5 feet with a maximum diameter of 4.2 meters or 14\\nfeet. hubble has many scientific instruments on board, which\\nincreases its weight to more than 24,000 pounds or 10,886\\nkilograms. it orbits at an altitude of roughly 340 miles. it\\norbits earth at a very high speed of 17,000 mph or 27,300\\nkmph, completing one orbit only in 95 minutes. hubble uses\\nits primary mirror to take most of the images, which has a\\ndiameter of roughly 2.4 meters or 94.5 inches.\\n150\\nbaby universe\\nhubble has two large solar panels that extend to 25 feet in\\ndirect sunlight and powers six nickel-hydrogen (nih) batteries,\\nwhich is the leading powerhouse of this telescope. it has been\\nthree decades since hubble started to work continuously in\\nspace. since then, more than 1.3 million different observations\\nhave taken place based upon which scientists have published\\nthousands of research papers. it is something that makes it\\neven more special. the very first image that hubble took was\\non may 20th, 1990; it was of a star cluster called ngc 3532.\\nsource: nasa, stsci, and esa\\nthere are many instruments placed on this telescope, which\\nwork as the eyes and heart of this telescope. from time to time,\\nastronauts have gone up and replaced the older instruments of\\nthis telescope. they have also installed some new instruments\\n151\\nour evolving world\\nfor better observations. here are some of the critical instruments\\npresent on hubble in space:\\n1. near-infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer:\\nthe near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer\\n(nicmos) is hubbleâ€™s heat sensor. these sensors are highly\\nsensitive to the infrared light produced by the vibrations of\\natoms and molecules. we humans cannot detect them, but its\\nabsorption causes the heating effect and they have another\\nname, heat waves. many objects are hidden in interstellar\\ndust, and nicmos enables us to see them. one of the primary\\nexamples of such objects are stellar birth sites. when new stars\\nare born, they are usually hidden in the cloud of dust and gas.\\nnicmos measures the heat of that star, and based upon the\\nheat, scientists can further calculate its geometry.\\n2. advanced camera for surveys; the advanced camera for\\nsurveys (acs) can see visible light. the excitation of electrons\\nin atoms generally produces visible light. by measuring the\\nvisible light, we can get most of the information about that\\nobject. by looking deep into space, scientists study some of the\\nearliest activities of the universe. using acs, scientists have\\nmeasured some of the most distant objects in the universe. acs\\nalso helps us map out the distribution of dark matter across the\\nuniverse by observing the gravitational lensing, which is the\\ndistortion caused by dark matter towards photons. search for\\nsmall or big planets around the stars is done by using acs.\\n3. wide field camera: the wide field camera (wfc) can\\ndetect the spectrum of three different kinds of light. nearultraviolet,\\nvisible, and near-infrared. it is one of the most\\ntechnologically leading instruments of hubble. wfc is\\n152\\nbaby universe\\nalso being used to study dark energy and dark matter. this\\ninstrument generally observes galaxies that are beyond the\\nvision of hubble.\\n4. cosmic origins spectrograph: the cosmic origins\\nspectrograph (cos)acts like prisms. cos works in separating\\nthe light coming from the deeper universe into its constituents.\\nby separating the light into its constituents, scientists can\\nmeasure the temperature, density and chemical composition\\nof objects in space.\\n5. space telescope imaging spectrograph: the space telescope\\nimaging spectrograph (stis) is a spectrograph that sees\\nultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. stis is generally\\nused to observe the larger objects of the universe. these larger\\nobjects include black holes, massive stars and clusters.\\n6. fine guidance sensor: fine guidance sensors (fgs) are\\ndevices that help hubble in keeping track of its direction. it\\nhelps in pointing hubble towards the right direction. hubble\\nmust point in the right direction when observing some sudden\\nphenomena in the universe. distance between the stars and\\ntheir relative motions can also be measured by using this device.\\nall of the given hubbleâ€™s instruments are powered by sunlight.\\nhubble is useless if not powered by the sunlight. hubble uses\\nlarge solar panels that convert sunlight directly into electricity.\\nduring its orbit around the earth, when hubble is in dark\\nshadow, these batteries keep the hubble running. another\\noption that scientists may use to keep the hubble running is\\nto use a nuclear reactor, but that is risky and costly. pictures\\ntaken by the hubble telescope will always make us remember\\nedwin hubble, the man who changed our view of the static\\n153\\nour evolving world\\nuniverse to a dynamic one.\\nover 15,000 research papers have been written based upon\\nthe data received from hubble telescope. we cannot list all\\nof them, but here are some of the most surprising discoveries\\nmade by hubble:\\n1. age of the universe: one of the hubbleâ€™s significant findings\\nis the age of the universe. based upon the data gathered from\\nhubble, we know that the universe is 13.8 billion years old.\\nby capturing the image of some of the most distant objects\\nand measuring how long and fast the universe is expanding,\\nhubble was able to determine the universeâ€™s age.\\n2. black holes: theoretically, everyone knew that supermassive\\nblack holes should exist, but there was still a lot of confusion\\nand discussion about whether they exist in space. hubble\\nshowed us that there is a supermassive black hole at the centre\\nof almost every large galaxy.\\n3. dark energy: edwin hubble discovered the expanding\\nuniverse, but he was not able to determine the precise rate of its\\nexpansion. the hubble telescope calculated that the universe\\nis not just expanding but also accelerating. the culprit behind\\nthis expansion is dark energy.\\n4. dark matter: dark matter is invisible to the instruments on\\nhubble, but it has one weak point. dark matter reveals itself in\\nthe form of gravity. scientists measured the distortion caused\\nby dark matterâ€™s gravity on moving light and constructed 3-d\\nmaps of where and how much dark matter is distributed.\\n5. gamma-ray bursts: gamma-ray bursts are one of the most\\npowerful explosions in the universe. they release an enormous\\n154\\nbaby universe\\namount of energy in a short period of time. they release more\\nenergy in a few seconds that our sun will release in its lifetime.\\nit was still a mystery how these explosions occur, but hubble\\nhelped us understand that these explosions occur as a result of\\nbig supernova explosions.\\nfor the last 30 years, hubble has been working day in and\\nday out, showing us the way into the universe. however, this\\nmachine also has its deadline. after this particular period, it\\nwill retire and most likely burn up in the atmosphere. hubble\\ncould last until 2030â€“2040. after hubble, its successor will be\\nthe james webb space telescope (jwst), scheduled to be\\nlaunched in 2021. jwst would be able to see what hubble\\ncould not. with an improved sensitivity and resolution, jwst\\nwould be able to see some of the most far away objects in\\nthe universe, such as the formation of the very first stars and\\ngalaxies.\\nlarge hadron collider\\nwe can say that we know everything about the universe, but\\nwe must accept that we are all just beginners. it has been\\npredicted by scientists that 95% of the entire universe is still\\nunknown. when we are talking about the universe, we are not\\nonly talking about the distant stars and galaxies, we are also\\ntalking about the universe at the atomic scale. we have made\\nsignificant accomplishments in the last 100 years, trying to\\nunderstand both the types of universes. the hubble telescope\\nhas helped us understand the universe that exists billions of\\nlight-years away, whereas the large hadron collider has\\nhelped us understand the universe within an atom.\\nif we must list the profound accomplishments of humanity\\n155\\nour evolving world\\nin the last 100 years, then the list would include computers,\\nsmartphones, humans on the moon, the use of the internet,\\nnuclear power and the large hadron collider. lhc is one of\\nthe most revolutionary machines of all time. this machine has\\nrevolutionized the world of particle physics. it has shown us a\\ndifferent world that exists at the level of atoms and below that\\nwas far beyond our reach. large hadron collider is the byproduct\\nof human achievements in the last 100 years.\\nlhc is the machine created to understand the universe inside\\nthe atoms. by revealing the mysteries of matter, lhc has\\ntaken us closer to the big bang and what happened during the\\nfirst 3 minutes succeeding it. higgs boson, a particle which\\ngives matter its mass, is one of the most significant discoveries\\nin human history made by this giant machine. the cern\\ncouncil approved the 1994 lhc project, but the final decision\\ncame two years later, and the construction of this giant machine\\nbegan.\\nthousands of tons of steel, iron, and thousands of mile-long\\nwire was used to build it. lhc also created cooperation\\nbetween scientists from different countries. when it was first\\ndesigned, hundreds of scientists and engineers came from\\ndifferent countries to work together on this project. the total\\ntunnel circumference of its tunnel is 27 kilometres, with a\\ntunnel diameter of about 3.8 m, buried under a depth of 70 to\\n140 meters.\\n156\\nbaby universe\\nsource: cern\\nhow does the lhc work?\\nlhc machine is vast and complex, but its working is\\nstraightforward. lhc is designed to smash the two counterrotating\\nbeams of particles at a very high energy. the powerful\\nmagnets guide these beams of particles in this machine. inside\\nlhc, two-particle beams are made to travel close to the speed\\nof light (99.999999%) before they smash into each other.\\nthis collision recreates the conditions of big bang for a small\\nfraction of a second. scientists have mounted various sensors\\nwhere these collisions occur. those sensors carefully record the\\ndata of colliding beams, which is later analysed by the team of\\nscientists. through collisions, physicists hope to find answers\\nto questions such as â€“ what is inside an atom? what did the\\nuniverse look like just after the big bang?\\nlhc is undoubtedly the worldâ€™s most powerful particle collider.\\n157\\nit was first switched on in the year 2008. many research papers\\nhave been published based upon the data received from lhc.\\nthis machine is still active and working, and who knows what\\nit might find next.\\n\\ntypes of civilization\\nhistory of humanity tells us how a continuous evolution made us what we are today. from being a single-cell organism to the most sophisticated biological machines on this planet has been a long journey. from what we have learned so far, the process of evolution never ends; even today, we are going through an evolution. however, we do not notice it because it is prolonged and steady. today we proudly call ourselves the most intelligent beings on this planet, only due to the continuous evolution. if the evolution had stopped 6 million years ago, all of us would still be apes living in the forest.\\nnot just humans, but the universe itself is going through the process of evolution. we calculate it in terms of entropy, the extent of increasing randomness. however, that is for another part to discuss. in this chapter, we will discuss future possibilities and where this evolution will lead us in a thousand or, perhaps, millions of years.\\nwhen it comes to our planet, we do not have total control over it. we have controlled many things up to a specific level, but there is a lot more to achieve. we have dug massive mines to extract coal, huge wells to take extract oil that lay buried for millions of years. however, there are still many things that we have yet to take control of, such as the floods, volcanic eruptions\\n159\\ntypes of civilization\\nand hurricanes that kill thousands of people every year. so, we\\nare not inevitable, not even on this planet. at least not yet.\\nwhen it comes to the solar system, we have not even reached\\nour closest planet. we have stepped on the moon, but it was\\nover 50 years ago. it seems like we forgot our way to return.\\nundoubtedly, voyager 1 has crossed the solar system and\\nreached interstellar space, but that small accomplishment alone\\ntook us over 40 years. in simple words, even after hundreds of\\nyears of trying to explore space, we are still stuck on this one\\nplanet that we call home.\\nwhen it comes to the milky way galaxy, we find ourselves on\\na distant edge orbiting a medium-sized star. we do not even\\nknow with precision how many stars there are in our galaxy.\\nsome astronomers predict that this number could be between\\n100 to 400 billion, but that is a very rough estimation. it tells\\nus how ignorant we are about our own galaxy. in the pursuit of\\ntrying to discover our place in the universe, we have built large\\ntelescopes. those telescopes have allowed us to look billions of\\nlight-years deep into space.\\nwhen it comes to the entire cosmos, we do not know where\\nwe stand today. we have observed distant galaxies and have\\nmapped out what our place could be. human civilization may\\nseem too advanced, but it is not. we find ourselves as beginners\\nwhen we look deeper into the night sky. i think it is better to\\nsay that we are like a small ant that came out of its home with\\na determination to explore the entire earth. overall, it would\\nbe better to say we do not know that we do not know.\\nin 1964, soviet astronomer nikolai kardashev proposed a\\nscale popularly known as the kardashev scale to classify the\\n160\\nbaby universe\\ndifferent types of civilizations living in our galaxy and the\\nuniverse. this scale was made to create a distinction between\\nthe types of civilizations based upon the amount and form of\\nenergy they can use. how we control different things, how we\\nare using our resources for a better future, and how far we can\\nreach today are the tools that will define our position on this\\nscale.\\nwe live in a very old galaxy that was formed soon after the\\ncreation of the universeâ€”so based upon the calculation, our\\ngalaxy could be hosting multiple civilizations, including typezero\\nand type-1. our universe, which is 13.8 billion years old,\\ncould be hosting type-zero, type-1, type-2, and even type-3\\ncivilizations. there is one more category, the type-4 civilization;\\na super-smart, unstoppable immortal civilization beyond\\nphysics, but it seems a bit exaggerated. what these different\\ntypes of civilizations are, let us discuss.\\ntype-zero civilization\\ntoday we can pat ourselves on the back and say how advanced\\nwe are. however, on the kardashev scale, we are still a type-\\nzero civilization. a type-zero civilization involves how life\\npreserves itself under the dramatic conditions of a planet. how\\nlife sails through the floods, hurricanes, and various natural\\ndisasters and still come out unharmed at the end of the day.\\nwe will remain a type-zero civilization until we can control\\nall these natural calamities around us. since the beginning\\nof time, the entire human history can be marked as a type-\\nzero civilization because we are still struggling to fight with\\nnature to preserve ourselves. when life was in the water, it had\\nits challenges, such as small creatures getting eaten by bigger\\n161\\ntypes of civilization\\ncreatures, and for bigger creatures, it was necessary to have a\\nparticular diet every day. when life came out of the water, it\\nhad its own unique challenges because now it was living in a\\nunique environment.\\ntoday we drive our cars on the road, but we never realize that\\nwe are using the energy of dead plants and animals that comes\\nin the form of oil. us still using coal as one of our primary\\nsources of energy is an example of how backward we are. we\\nare not even an intercontinental civilization because we have\\ndivided ourselves in the form of small countries and have\\ndifferent laws. the division of humanity in the form of countries\\nprotected by borders has its advantages and disadvantages. one\\nof the advantages is that the growth of a country is directly\\nlinked to its peopleâ€™s overall growth, but it also limits us in\\nseveral ways. this division prevents us from calling ourselves a\\nplanetary civilization working together for the betterment of\\nall humanity.\\nthe division in the form of countries is fine because countries\\ncan have relations with each other and work together as\\nfriendly nations, but we have further divided ourselves. the\\nintroduction of religion, caste, and race had its advantage\\n1000 years back. race, case, and religion had brought people\\ntogether in the form of groups, and now they were able to\\nrelate with each other with a common god or with a common\\ncaste. however, in the modern world, these things prevent us\\nfrom taking a step forward. whenever there is a significant\\nscientific discovery or breakthrough, religious people often say\\nthat look it is already written in our book. this shows how\\neager we are to protect our limited religious identity. we are far\\naway from accepting a universal identity.\\n162\\nbaby universe\\nwe might have differences, religious or otherwise, but in the\\nlast 100 years, we have taken some bold steps towards becoming\\na type-1 civilization. the creation of the european union in\\n1993, which is greatly admired, is just one of them. it is not that\\nhuman beings do not want to come together and work as one.\\nwe have proven that we can act as one, but it usually happens\\nin extreme situations when we feel that there is no other way.\\nin the 1980s, when we came to know that the ozone layer is\\ndepleting due to the excessive use of chlorofluorocarbons, the\\nentire world came together and signed the montreal protocol\\nto limit their use. today we can see that the ozone hole is\\nhealing slowly and will recover fully in the next 50 years.\\nthese shackles bind a type-zero civilization (that we are). it\\nstill follows the path shown by its ancestors 1000 years ago and\\nhesitates to do something different. however, if we want to\\nbecome an advanced civilization and move towards becoming\\na type-1 civilization, education is the only tool to make it\\nhappen. modern education has its flaws; most of it is limited\\nto remembering dates, names, and other data with no logical\\n163\\ntypes of civilization\\nthinking. so, we should think about that as well.\\nwe are living in a world that is evolving rapidly. if we go\\n100 years back, we would see bullock carts on the streets, but\\nwithin the next century, we have developed fast cars that can\\nreach over 300 mph and have even developed fighter jets that\\ncan challenge the speed of sound. this is a clear signal that we\\nare transforming from a type-zero to type-1 civilization even\\nthough we are decades back from actually doing so. this is one\\nof the most decisive times that we are living in. our children\\nare not only able to see this transition, but becoming a part\\nof it is a significant achievement for us. we can hope for the\\ncomplete transition of this civilization in the next 100 to 200\\nyears. it is not clear that we are going to make it based on the\\nchallenges we face. however, let us be positive and suppose that\\nwe make it. it will be one of the most prominent achievements\\nof humankind.\\nwe are divided so much in so many ways that this transition\\nbecomes the most dangerous and crucial one. the religious\\ndivision can work its way out; the division based on caste will\\nfade away as we educate our children, but one of the most\\ndangerous divisions is the political division. some of the most\\ndeveloped countries, such as the united states, are primarily\\ndivided due to the politics and policies their leaders choose.\\nthese divisions put a question mark on whether we are going\\nto make this transition. it is our fight against ourselves. it is a\\nrace against the multicultural fabric that makes it necessary but\\nalso extremely dangerous at the same time.\\nother than religion and politics, several other factors are\\nalso preventing this transition. we have weapons of mass\\n164\\nbaby universe\\ndestruction, biological weapons, nuclear weapons, advanced\\nnuclear intercontinental missile systems that can wipe out\\nhumanity. we also have the problem of terrorism and various\\nterrorist groups that are preventing this transition.\\nthis transformation might seem difficult, but it is not impossible.\\nin just the last 100 years, we have connected ourselves in such\\na way that was never thought to be possibleâ€”the use of the\\ninternet to chat with somebody living on a different continent\\nand the use of a telephone to get in touch with our loved ones\\nanytime and anywhere are some excellent examples. on top\\nof everything, we have adopted english as our international\\nlanguage. today people from different parts of the world can\\ncommunicate with each other effectively. english is the worldâ€™s\\nmost accepted second language, which is a positive sign towards\\nbecoming a type 1 civilization.\\ntype 1 civilization\\nwe have already discussed what a type zero civilization is and\\nhow we are slowly transitioning into a type 1 civilization. it\\nis time to understand what being a type 1 civilization would\\nbe like. a type 1 civilization is a planetary civilization. this\\ncivilization can use and store all of the energy available on its\\nplanet. in simple words, this type of civilization can control\\neverything happening on the planet.\\na planetary civilization has the power of an entire planet in\\ntheir hands. it can control earthquakes. it can use the energy\\nbursting from the volcano. it has the technological power to\\nstop the hurricanes from causing massive damage to human\\nlives. instead of burning coal, petroleum and destroying\\nnature, a type 1 civilization can harness the energy that falls\\n165\\ntypes of civilization\\non a planet from its parent star. it would not just be able to\\ncollect the energy of its parent star but also be store it to meet\\nthe increasing demands of the population. this ability will\\nfurther revolutionize our industries and technological era. this\\ncivilization will have a robust defence system in space that will\\ndeflect any asteroid that can potentially harm the lives of its\\ninhabitants.\\nthere will be large-scale use of nuclear power. a type 1\\ncivilization will use the energy of atoms itself through fusion\\nand use it to power their industries. being able to harness\\nearthâ€™s energy would also mean that we would have total\\ncontrol over all the natural forces. we would be able to use the\\nenergy of wind, construct more dams on flowing rivers, and use\\nthe energy of ocean waves.\\nfor us humans, as a type 1 civilization, the language we\\nwill speak will be english. everyone in the world would\\nrequire knowing english as their first or second language to\\ncommunicate with everyone else on the planet. this type of\\ncivilization will be very open to new ideas. religion will no\\nlonger exist, or at least the majority of people will not consider\\nthemselves religious. instead, they will consider themselves\\nseekers, trying to understand their existence. this civilization\\nwill no longer have a limited identity, limited to their caste,\\nreligion, or nation. their identity will be cosmic or at least a\\nhuman. borders still might exist between countries, but they\\nwould have very little significance due to the equal distribution\\nof economic wealth around the planet. today we see free\\nmovement among the european union countries, that is how\\npeopleâ€™s movement would be.\\n166\\nbaby universe\\nthe internet is a planetary communication system. we can\\ncontact anyone from anywhere, except for a few countries who\\nlike to be secretive. in a similar way, there will be a planetary\\nflow of knowledge and culture without any restrictions. by\\nthe time we become a planetary civilization, we would have\\nseveral human missions on mars, and we would have multiple\\ncolonies on the moon. it is not clear if we would be able to\\ntransform and colonize mars, but colonizing the moon would\\nbe a great start. most important of all, a planetary civilization\\nwould have complete knowledge of the solar system. we\\nwould know if there is alien life living underwater on europa,\\ntitan or enceladus. our probes would be almost every planet\\nand their moon in the solar system, exploring the presence of\\nlife and the nature of the atmosphere. we would have started\\nmining asteroids for metals and other important ores.\\nwe are no doubt progressing, but we are currently another 100\\nto 200 years behind. carl sagan thought we are currently at\\n0.7 of the way to become a type 1 civilization.\\ntype 2 civilization\\nafter becoming a type 1 civilization, we will most likely leave\\nearth. we will look for other energy sources from other parts\\nof the solar system. a type 1 planetary civilization can harness\\nthe energy of a planet, but a type 2 civilization would require\\nenergy directly from its mother star. a type 2 civilization is\\nalso called a stellar civilization that can use and control energy\\nat the scale of its entire solar system. the energy of a planet is\\nnot enough to fulfil their needs so they will look up-to their\\nmother star and use the power of their star to power their huge\\nmachines.\\n167\\ntypes of civilization\\nin order to harness the energy of their mother star, type 2\\ncivilization will use the concept of the dyson sphere. a dyson\\nsphere is a device that would encompass every single inch of\\nthe star and gather almost all of its energy. this energy will be\\ntransferred to a planet and stored there for later use. type 2\\ncivilization will use this energy to power their giant machines.\\nthey will use it to power their giant spaceships, which would\\nhave the potential to travel to nearby stars.\\ndyson sphere is just one of the many ways a type 2 civilization\\ncan use its starâ€™s energy. this civilization would use star lifting\\nto meet its energy needs. it is a process where they would be\\nable to remove a substantial portion of a starâ€™s matter in a very\\ncontrolled manner without affecting the inner core fusion of\\nthe star or disbalancing its inner and outer pressure and use that\\nmatter for other purposes. not only our star, this civilization\\nwould also utilize the hydrogen of nearby gas giants. they\\nwould drain their energy using the orbiting reactor and bring\\nthat energy back to their home planet for further use.\\na type 2 civilization would have not only transformed but also\\ncolonized mars. it would have colonized almost every place in\\nthe solar system wherever possible. a type 1 civilization would\\nbe able to deflect large asteroids from hitting their home planet,\\nbut a type 2 civilization would be able to do something more.\\nif a giant asteroid starts traveling towards their home planet,\\nthey would be able to use high energy machines orbiting their\\nplanet and vaporize that asteroid entirely long before it reaches\\ntheir planet. however, let us suppose it cannot vaporize the\\nasteroid due to some problems, then it would be able to change\\nthe orbit of their planet so that the collision does not happen.\\nnot only their planet, they would be able to move other planets\\n168\\nbaby universe\\nin the solar system as well.\\nthis civilization would use the energy of antimatter and\\nwould be able to create and handle it without any concerns.\\nthis civilization would be able to send multiple rockets into\\nthe galaxy that will explore further life. they will not only have\\nthe complete knowledge of their entire solar system but will\\nalso be ready to move to the galactic scale. life as a type 2\\ncivilization would be about technology and science, not about\\nfamily and friends. many people have this question in mind\\nthat if there are millions of habitable planets in our galaxy alone,\\nthen why donâ€™t we see the aliens here on earth? why doesnâ€™t\\nalien life come here and visit us? well, maybe we are not that\\ninteresting to them. maybe they know we are here, but they are\\nletting us live comfortably and not disturbing our daily lives.\\nthe reason for that could be that we are not technologically\\nadvanced enough. so, they are choosing to ignore us. another\\npossibility is that there is alien life out there not in the form of\\na little green man who can sit in his oval spaceship and travel\\nanywhere in the universe. instead, it is in the form of a type\\nzero or type 1 civilization that has not travelled beyond their\\nsolar system. maybe they are hoping that one day we will find\\nthem as our part of space exploration.\\nsome scientists predict that if we ever encounter alien life or\\nalternatively, if there is ever a time when aliens visit us, then\\nit will be as a type 2 or type 3 civilization. because only that\\ncivilization has the capability to travel vast distances between\\nsolar systems and reach us. however, we see no shreds of\\nevidence of alien life visiting us. we are trying to find a type\\nzero civilization in our solar system on the moons of different\\nplanets.\\n169\\ntypes of civilization\\nwhen you become a type 2 civilization, you are immortal.\\nthere are no known forces in the universe that can destroy\\nyour existence. even if their mother planet gets destroyed\\nby accident, this civilization will fly to another planet in the\\nsolar system. even if a supernova explosion occurs nearby\\ndestroying almost all its life, this civilization can still enter its\\ngiant spaceship and move towards other stars and solar systems\\nwhere they could survive.\\nright now, as a type zero civilization transitioning into a type\\n1, we are creating small probes and sending them to nearby\\nplanets and moons within the solar system. however, a type\\n2 civilization would be able to create an army of bionic robots\\nand send them to nearby stars so that they can start life on\\nnearby solar systems. these bionic robots would be able to\\ntransform themselves according to the planetary situations, so\\nthe environment is not a big concern unless it is way too hot\\nor way too cold.\\nsometimes you go to bed, and you forget to turn off the lights.\\nso, with a sleepy mood, you get out of bed and turn off the\\nlights. this type of civilization would be able to control most\\nof the things mentally. they would not have to walk towards\\nthe switch and physically turn it off. their brain would have\\nenough power to do so. suppose you want to talk to your\\nrelatives, what you do is take the phone out of your pocket, dial\\ntheir number and talk to them. in our case, our smart-phone\\nworks as an extension of our intelligence and lets us do many\\nthings. this civilization would not have to do all this work to\\ncontact someone. their brains would have enough power or\\nwould be wired in such a way that they just have to think about\\nsomething to make it happen.\\n170\\nbaby universe\\na type 2 civilization is a big jump in capability and intelligence.\\nhow close are we to becoming one? well, it will probably take\\n1000-2000 years to reach that point.\\ndyson sphere\\ntype 3 civilization\\na type 3 civilization is a galactic civilization. it is a civilization\\nthat can possess the energy of their galaxy. in simple words,\\na type 3 civilization would have access to power equal to the\\nenergy of an entire galaxy. if humans ever become a type 3\\ncivilization, then our humanity would be left much behind in\\nthe process, and we would become a cyborg (beings with both\\nbiological and robotic abilities).\\na type 3 civilization would use all the tools and methods that\\nit learned as type 2 civilization and apply it on a galactic scale.\\ntype 3 civilization would be able to build dyson spheres all\\nover the milky way galaxy and harness the power of as many\\nstars as they want. they would use this energy to do the things\\nthat appear in science fiction today. they would use the energy\\n171\\ntypes of civilization\\nof stars to travel at speed close to light. by traveling at a speed\\nclose to that of light, they would be able to travel in time, as\\nexplained in the twin paradox.\\nthe remarkable quality of this civilization would be that it\\nwill not be one planet or multi-planet centred. instead, it will\\nspread its arms around the milky way galaxy and try to live on\\nas many planets as possible. black holes would become just\\nanother source of energy for them. they will use the energy\\nof not just stars but also be able to harness the energy of black\\nholes to power their giant machines. they would be able to\\nwithstand the high gravitational potential of black holes, and\\nthat way would be able to travel forward in time. by using the\\nvast energy of black holes, a type 3 civilization would be able\\nto create wormholes and travel inside the galaxy or in-between\\nthe galaxies within a short period of time.\\nfor this civilization, there will be no boundaries to science.\\nthey will have the ability to prevent supernova explosions.\\nthey would use the strong magnetic field of neutron stars for\\ntheir benefit. a type 3 civilization would not be limited to one\\ngalaxy only. as soon as a type 2 civilization became smart and\\ncapable, it tried to reach other solar systems. in the same way,\\na type 3 civilization would not just rule a single galaxy, and\\ninstead will try and reach out to other galaxies.\\nonce this civilization becomes intelligent enough, it would\\nnot need to steal energy from stars or black holes. empty space\\ndoes not mean nothing, it has the power of dark matter, dark\\nenergy, radiations and particles popping up and going out of\\nexistence. so, this civilization would be able to use the energy\\nof space itself and travel as long distances as they want. in order\\n172\\nbaby universe\\nto boost their rockets, they will use the energy of space. there\\nare vast distances between galaxies, so the use of the energy of\\nspace would allow them to travel between the galaxies in case\\nwormholes do not work out. by doing all these things, this\\ncivilization will play with the laws of nature to its fullestâ€”\\nsomething that we want to do right now, but due to the lack of\\ntechnology, we cannot.\\nnot just regular black holes, they would be able to snatch\\nenergy from the supermassive black holes which exist at the\\ncentre of almost every galaxy. we humans are afraid of gammaray\\nbursts because they release an enormous amount of energy\\nin a short period of time. for a type 3 civilization, a gamma-ray\\nburst would be a source of pure energy coming directly from\\na black hole.\\na type 3 civilization would have the knowledge of everything\\nwhich will help them become the masters of space and time.\\ndark matter would no longer be a riddle for them, and they\\nwould be able to use the power of dark energy for their benefit.\\nthis civilization would be able to create colonies of cyborgs\\ncapable of self-replication and send them to nearby galaxies\\nfor exploration purposes. their population might also increase\\nrapidly in millions as every cyborg would be able to selfreplicate\\nand colonize every star that comes in its path.\\n173\\ntypes of civilization\\na type 3 civilization would probably have the highest order of\\nevolution. we are nowhere close to that. for us, it would take\\n100,000 years or maybe longer to get there.\\ntype 4 civilization and more\\na type 4 civilization is a universal civilization that can control\\nall the laws of the universe. kardashev believed that no\\ncivilization could become a type 4 because the capabilities and\\npower it will have are almost god-like. kardashev also believed\\nthat humans or any alien creature would not be able to cope\\nwith such powers. many scientists believe that it is possible for\\nsuch a civilization to exist, so types 4, 5, and 6 civilizations have\\nalready been proposed.\\none of the big reasons why it is almost impossible for a\\ncivilization to become a type 4 civilization is because our\\nuniverse has a limited age and will die one day. which means we\\nhave limited time to transform ourselves into beings of higher\\ncapabilities. this civilization does not abide by any known rules\\n174\\nbaby universe\\nor laws of the universe. a type 4 civilization would be able\\nto harness the energy of the universe itself. this civilization\\nwould be so intelligent that it would open the singularity of\\nblack holes and even live inside supermassive black holes.\\nthe type 3 civilization has exploited almost all known sources\\nof energy, so a type 4 civilization would have to tap into sources\\nof energy unknown to us. they must discover or generate new\\nlaws of physics and govern the universe however they want.\\na type 4 civilization would be able to teleport themselves by\\nvarious means; wormholes are just one of them. they would\\nbe able to create wormholes in this universe that open in a\\ndifferent universe. that way, they would be able to travel\\nbetween universes and discover different kinds of scientific\\nlaws. they might find a universe where everything is made\\nup of antimatter. they must be careful while entering that\\nuniverse because they are made up of ordinary matter, and\\nantimatter will not get along well with them.\\nour current science parameters cannot describe this type of\\ncivilization because it is beyond all the parameters and rules we\\nknow of. their mental abilities are beyond the grasp of science.\\nthis civilization would have unlocked all the mysteries of the\\nuniverse. one more important thing that we would know is\\nwhether we are living in a simulation. since they can travel\\nbetween different universes, they must know these answers.\\ntoday we know about three dimensions of space and one\\ndimension of time. however, theories are suggesting that there\\ncould be many more dimensions beyond our reach. a type 4\\ncivilization would be able to travel to higher dimensions and\\neven to dimensions that are as small as the size of an atom.\\n175\\ntypes of civilization\\na type 5 can do the same thing in a multiverse that a type 4\\ncivilization can do in this universe. they can even create their\\nown universes with their own unique laws and parameters.\\nwhat a type 6 civilization would do, we cannot even imagine.\\nmaybe it will discover something completely unknown yet\\nas it goes through the foam of the multiverse and creates its\\nuniverses. only time will answer these questions as we progress\\nin this journey.\\nhumans are far behind from reaching something like this.\\nthe first obstacle we have in our path is the transition from a\\ntype zero civilization to a type 1 civilization. if we do not blow\\nourselves with the various kinds of weapons we have created\\nand successfully pass this transition in the next 200 years, it\\nwould be a good start towards this goal. if we want to achieve\\nthis goal quickly, we must be focused on science instead of war\\nand rough politics.\\n176\\nend of life on earth\\na famous man once said, â€˜two things are infinite. the universe and human stupidity, and i am not so sure about the universe.â€™ humans might be the brainiest species of this galaxy, but they do not know how to handle power with responsibility. humans splitting the atom and discovering a whole new world inside it was a tremendous success, but at the end of it, what we did was build nuclear bombs, which can destroy the entirety of humanity once and for all if placed in the wrong hands.\\nduring the cold war, there was a nuclear arms race between the soviet union, the united states, and their respective allies. by the 1980s, there were over 70,000 nuclear weapons, enough to destroy this planet several times. as the cold war ended, both countries agreed to reduce their stockpile significantly. which i consider to be one of the best decisions taken by our past leaders. even though both countries did not agree to reduce their stockpile to zero, the number came down below 14,000.\\nsome people might not agree, but nuclear weapons have played a significant role in keeping world peace. after world war 1 and world war 2, these weapons of mass destruction came into existence on a massive scale, and we have not seen a major war since then. nuclear weapons are handy when it\\n177\\nend of life on earth\\ncomes to threatening other nations and make them align with\\nyour terms. powerful nations have been using this tactic for\\ndecades. some people argue that why donâ€™t we nuke terrorist\\norganizations to end them, but we cannot do so. because\\ndoing so will spread silence over that region and thousands of\\ninnocents will die as well.\\ntoday 9 countries in the world possess a total of 13,870-13,910\\nnuclear weapons. the united states and russia account for 91\\npercent of them. many countries have given up their deadly\\nweapons and nuclear programs in the past 30 years, whereas\\nsome others have tried to acquire them. there have been many\\ninstances when people questioned the existence of humanity.\\nthere are various ways in which humanity could end one day.\\nwe will focus on the five more realistic ways this could happen.\\nlet us take a closer look.\\nnuclear warfare\\nnuclear warfare is one of the biggest and realistic threats\\nthat can wipe out entire humanity. nuclear warfare which is\\nalso called thermonuclear warfare or atomic warfare. it refers\\nto the use of nuclear weapons to destroy and damage the\\nenemy for resolving political strategy or conflict. in contrast\\nto conventional warfare, nuclear warfare is highly destructive\\nand damaging. a nuclear weapon can release a large amount\\nof energy in a short period, which could have a long-lasting\\nimpact on humanity, environment, soil, and almost everything\\nelse.\\non july 16th, 1945, the united states tested its first nuclear\\nbomb in new mexico. after this test, the world entirely\\nchanged within three weeks, because on august 6th, 1945, the\\n178\\nbaby universe\\nunited states dropped this weapon of mass destruction on\\nhiroshima, a city of japan. it wounded many people and killed\\napproximately 130,000 people. three days later, another city of\\njapan, nagasaki, was bombed. this blast instantly killed 74,000\\npeople. there was chaos, fear, and terror on the entire planet\\nafter these two explosions. these tremendously powerful blasts\\nalso resulted in the end of world war ii.\\nwhat would happen if global nuclear warfare occurred?\\nthe effects of a nuclear explosion will be similar to\\nconventional explosions but on a vast scale. the shock wave\\nproduced by this explosion can directly injure humans by\\nrupturing their eardrums, and many fatalities occur because\\nof collapsing structures like buildings and flying debris. in\\ncontrast to conventional explosions, a single nuclear explosion\\ncan generate such a powerful pulse of thermal radiation that\\nit can set fire and burn skin over large areas. fire ignited by\\nthese explosions in some cases can change into a firestorm,\\npreventing the escape of the people who survived the direct\\nexplosion. it is difficult to predict accurately, but according to\\nnuclear experts, thermal effects from a nuclear explosion will\\nbe the significant cause of deaths.\\nwhen a nuclear blast occurs close to the ground surface, soil\\nparticles mix with the highly radioactive fission products from\\nthe nuclear bomb. this debris may get transferred from the\\ndetonation site to other places by the wind and fall back to the\\nearth. a nuclear war could cause instant casualties, injuries,\\ninfrastructure damage from the blast and heat of detonation,\\nand long-lasting radiological effects from both the initial\\nnuclear radiation and the radioactive fallout that settles after\\n179\\nend of life on earth\\nthe first event.\\nthere will be long-term effects on the people that come in\\nthe contact of these radiations. these effects include cancer\\ndevelopment, gene mutation, and genetic damage. the\\nsurvivors of the nuclear detonation and the population of\\ncontaminated areas will be at high risk of such effects. not just\\nhumans but all the animals will also get affected equally with\\nthese radiations. wherever there is a large amount of radiation\\nsuch as at old nuclear test sites, no life can survive there. if it is\\nunderwater, no aquatic life can survive as well.\\nthe thought of nuclear war may create images of emerging\\nmushroom clouds, duck and cover drills, or local radiation\\nfallout. these instant effects are terrifying, but experts say the\\nfallout of a nuclear war would likely last well beyond the initial\\nexplosions. the aftereffects of a nuclear explosion are more\\ndamaging than the initial explosions.\\nnuclear winter is a severe and durable global cooling effect\\nwhich is supposed to occur after extensive firestorms following\\na nuclear war. the hypothesis is that such explosions can eject\\nsoot into the earthâ€™s atmosphere, blocking sun rays from\\nreaching the earthâ€™s surface. according to scientists, if all the\\nrussian and american nuclear weapons were used in a conflict\\ntoday, we could expect a dreadful drop in global temperatures,\\nvery less precipitation, and a lot less food to go around.\\nin such wars, nuclear particles will be transported between the\\nhemispheres within two weeks. global temperatures would\\nthen sink by around 9 degrees celsius over the next year. this\\ndecline could continue to another 1.6 degrees celsius. in many\\nregions across north america and europe, even summer will\\n180\\nbaby universe\\nbe a frozen hellbent some 20 degrees celsius chilled than it\\nis now and at least for a few seasons. those who survive by\\nrunning and bunking down for four or five years will then need\\nto worry about starvation.\\nwhat is the use of nuclear weapons?\\nwe may never use nuclear weapons unless we decide to destroy\\nourselves. however, there are some hypothetical scenarios in\\nwhich these weapons can be beneficial. suppose a 1 km wide\\nasteroid is heading straight towards the earth. right now,\\nwe do not have any space defence mechanism to deflect or\\ndestroy that asteroid. so, we can use our nuclear weapons to\\ndestroy it in space long before it reaches us. some of you might\\nbe thinking that it would create even more small pieces of\\nasteroids that will fall on earth. you are right. however, it is\\nbetter to get hit by 100 pieces of asteroids which are 10 to 50\\nmeters in diameter than getting hit by a 1 km giant asteroid.\\nthose 100 pieces might destroy 100 different cities and end\\nup killing up to 1 million people, but a 1 km wide asteroid can\\ndestroy a nation as big as india, killing billions of people.\\nnot just one nation, its impact will risk sudden climate change\\nthat will make other countries suffer for decades to come.\\nother than that, we can use our nuclear weapons against extraterrestrial\\nthreats whose chances are almost negligible but not\\nzero.\\nclimate change\\nanother realistic threat that humanity is facing even today is\\nour slowly changing climate. in simple words, climate change\\nis the constant change in the condition of wind, rainfall,\\n181\\nend of life on earth\\ntemperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and other such\\nelements on this planetâ€™s surface. when these usual conditions\\nshow drastic changes over a period only then we can say that\\nclimate change has taken place. climate change can be due\\nto natural or human actions. earth has seen various dramatic\\nclimate changes over its history, including the last ice age.\\nclimate change through human actions includes actions like\\npopulation explosion, deforestation, excessive use of fossil fuels,\\nautomobiles, industrial waste, and hazards.\\nthe history of climate change is based upon the scientific\\ndiscoveries that began in the early 19th century when\\nnatural climate changes were first suspected, and the natural\\ngreenhouse effect was observed. today these effects are much\\nmore apparent. we can feel the change in our atmosphere,\\nwe can observe the winters getting colder and the summers\\ngetting hotter. some countries have even seen large scale heat\\nwaves in summer in the last few years. every year we see a\\ndrop in the amount of ice present on the north and south pole\\nof the planet, which is clear evidence that our planet is slowly\\nheating up.\\nduring the summer, rising temperatures around the world\\ncreate a fear among people and climate activists, which is\\ngenuine to have. in march 2020, the average temperature in\\neurope was 2 degrees celsius above average of 1981-2010.\\ntemperature results were much more unpleasant in other\\ncountries such as russia and ukraine. some parts of the\\nworld experienced temperatures up-to six degrees higher than\\naverage over the course of months. we should not forget that\\nyear 2016 was recorded as the hottest year since we started\\nrecording temperature. experts fear that as the climate\\n182\\nbaby universe\\ncontinues to change, the chances of new infections, diseases,\\nand outbreaks could increase significantly.\\nin the next 20 years, our planetâ€™s average temperature could\\nincrease by about 0.2â°c per 10 years. the rise of greenhouse gas\\nejections and the increase in carbon dioxide worldwide would\\ncause a further rise in global temperatures and other climatic\\nchanges in this century. it is expected that the temperatures\\ncould rise by over 4 â°c by the end of this century. with the\\nincrease in temperature, the sea levels are expected to rise by\\n18 cm to 59 cm. other expected changes include reduced snow\\ncover and sea ice across the planet, acidification of our oceans,\\nmore frequent heat waves, intense tropical cyclones and more\\nfrequent floods.\\nthe long-term effects of climate change are even more\\nhorrifying. sea level rise and global warming caused by human\\nactivities will continue for centuries. as that happens, there will\\nbe even more floods across the coastal regions, and more people\\nliving in those areas will migrate to safer places. if warming\\nexists over many centuries, it could lead to an increase in global\\nsea levels by over 7 meters. it is scary because if that happens,\\nmany countries such as new zealand will be the worst hit by\\nits side effects. we could also see a complete melting of the\\ngreenland ice sheet that would further add water to the rising\\noceans.\\nwe cannot stop climate change completely, but we can at least\\nprevent it from getting much worse. we can slow down its\\npace and get more time in our hands to be able to handle this\\nproblem. the simplest thing we can all do is to put pressure\\non the government to act urgently and teach its importance\\n183\\nend of life on earth\\nto our younger generation. almost all the people reading this\\nbook will be gone by the end of this century, but the coming\\ngeneration will have to face the consequences of climate change\\ncaused by our actions.\\na pandemic\\nthe world has seen many pandemics throughout history. a\\npandemic is nothing but the spread of a new disease around the\\nglobe. the most recent covid-19 outbreak around the world\\nis the best example of a pandemic because its virus has reached\\nalmost every continent. in the 14th century, the human race\\nfaced a dreadful pandemic, which is estimated to have killed\\n75 to 200 million people, which was approximately 40% of\\nthe total population at that time. that pandemic is popularly\\nknown as black death. other well-known pandemics include\\nsmallpox, tuberculosis, spanish flu, and covid-19.\\nthe influenza pandemic (spanish flu) 1918\\nspanish flu was one of the deadliest known pandemics\\nof modern history. it infected almost 1/3rd of the global\\npopulation and killed over 50 million people within the short\\ninterval of january 1918 to december 1920. this pandemic\\nimpacted people from every age, unlike covid-19, which is\\nmore deadly for sick and elder people. young, old, sick, and\\neven healthy people became infected, and over 10% of them\\ncould not make it.\\nspanish flu arose in the us midwest. as world war 1 was\\ngoing on at that time, soldiers shipped to the front lines took it\\nto europe with them. countries like britain, germany, france,\\nand america kept it secret in the beginning, in a bid to keep\\n184\\nbaby universe\\nthe morale of their forces high during world war -1. when\\nthe disease became a pandemic, it seemed to have emerged in\\nspain. hence, it was named â€œspanishâ€ flu.\\nthis pandemic occurred in two different phasesâ€”a milder\\nform in early 1918, which affected mainly sick and older\\npeople. most people who died from it either were already\\nsick or were too old to fight against it. spanish flu was first\\nsuspected around march 1918. throughout april and may of\\nyear 1918, the virus spread like wildfire in england, france,\\nspain, and italy via the army troops during world war 1. the\\nsecond wave of this virus began in august 1918, and it was\\nmuch more deadly compared to the first wave. it affected the\\nimmune system of younger adults. in late august 1918, the\\nfatal severity of spanish fluâ€™s â€œsecond waveâ€ was caused by a\\nmutated strain of virus spread by wartime troop movements.\\nas a result, more people were killed in the second wave of this\\nvirus than the first one.\\n185\\nend of life on earth\\nduring this pandemic, people were struck with blistering fever\\n(104 degrees), malaise, nasal haemorrhaging, and pneumonia.\\nthe patient would drown in their fluid-filled lungs and were\\nnot able to breathe properly. the major cause of its high\\nfatality was pneumonia and other respiratory complications\\nwhich were brought by the flu. as who did not exist during\\nworld war -1, the situation was uncontrollable. nobody had a\\nclear idea of what to do with this pandemic, and there was no\\norganization to direct other countries to take concrete steps to\\ncontrol its spread.\\nworldwide, the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 killed more\\npeople in a year than what the black death killed in a century.\\nit killed more people in just 24 weeks than aids killed in\\n24 years. in india, it is referred to as bombay fever. the death\\ntoll in india was estimated to be 10-20 million, whereas the\\nus death toll was 0.6 million approximately, which made\\nindia the worst-hit country. a large percentage of the indian\\npopulation died due to this pandemic. 1911-1921 is the only\\ncensus period in which the indian population fell.\\nif countries take proper measures, then such pandemics can\\nbe stopped. world has become more globalized than ever,\\nand there is far more travel between countries in the form of\\ntourism and work than it ever has been. this makes it easy for\\na virus to spread quickly and effectively. the covid-19 has\\nreached every continent within 3 to 4 months because people\\ncoming from other countries brought it with them. next time\\na pandemic occurs, the first step should be to completely freeze\\nthe global travel and quickly learn more about the virus.\\n186\\nbaby universe\\nsupervolcano\\nany volcano whose volcanic eruption is higher than 1,000\\ncubic kilometres by volume is called supervolcano. volcanic\\neruption of a supervolcano is a thousand times greater than\\nthe typical volcano. examples of supervolcanoes that have\\nvolcanic eruptions greater than 1,000 cubic kilometres include\\nlong valley in eastern california, yellowstone, taupo in new\\nzealand, and toba in indonesia.\\nthere are few supervolcanoes on earth; globally there are\\nabout 20 known supervolcanoes. supervolcanic eruptions\\noccur very rarely, only once every 100,000 years on average, but\\nwhen they do erupt, they have an unpleasant impact on the\\natmosphere and climate. the last time such a volcano erupted\\nwas yellowstone caldera, about 650,000 years ago. nowadays,\\nit is a famous yellowstone national park in the united states.\\nthis eruption ejected over 1,000 cubic kilometres of lava and\\nash into the atmosphere, which was large enough to bury\\nan entire city several feet under the ashes. the effect of such\\neruptions is comparable to holding a volleyball underwater.\\nwhen you release it, the air-filled volleyball is forced upwards\\nby the high-density water around it. as a result, we see a quick\\nand violent eruption.\\nyellowstone volcano\\nthe yellowstone volcano is one of the biggest known\\nsupervolcanoes. the standard view of this volcano is not like\\nthe other supervolcanoes. it is so big that one can only see its\\nshape from the ground. even its aerial view would not look\\nlike a typical cone volcano like mt rainier. the magma of\\n187\\nend of life on earth\\nyellowstone volcano is very explosive, thick, and almost pastelike.\\nonce this type of magma comes near the surface, the gas\\nit contains expands and explodes violently. if you think the\\nmagma chamber of mt saint helens to be the size of a pea,\\nthen the magma chamber of the yellowstone volcano would be\\nthe size of an apple in comparison.\\nwhat if yellowstone volcano erupted?\\nyellowstone is not just an american fortune, it is one of the\\nworldâ€™s oldest national parks, established in 1872. yellowstone\\nspreads across 8,987 square kilometres in multiple states.\\nnearly 3 million people visit this park every year to enjoy a\\nstunning natural landscape that includes a plethora of hiking\\ntrails and old faithful geysers, hot springs, and mountain peaks.\\nbelow the surface of this park lurks another natural wonder,\\none with the power to wipe the park off the map.\\nthis volcano has a massive source of magma. although there\\nis no possibility of its eruption anytime soon, a full explosion\\nwould be bad for nature lovers and people anywhere near the\\npark. if this volcano were to erupt, heat rising from within\\nthe earthâ€™s core would begin to dissolve the molten rock\\nbelow the groundâ€™s surface. that will create a mixture of rocks,\\nmagma, vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases. as the mixture\\naccumulates and rises over thousands of years, the pressure will\\npush the ground upward into a dome/hemisphere shape and\\ncreate cracks along the edges. as that pressure is released via\\nthe cracks at the edges, the dissolved gases will explode, quickly\\nemptying the magma across the park.\\n188\\nbaby universe\\nits eruption may kill as many as 100,000 people instantly\\nand spread a 3-meter layer of molten ash as far as 1,600\\nkilometres from the park. rescuers probably will have an\\nextremely difficult time getting in there. the ash would block\\nall points of entry from the ground and spread gases and ash\\ninto the atmosphere that would stop most airflow, just as it\\ndid when a much smaller volcano erupted in 2010 in iceland.\\nthe aftereffects of its eruption are equally as frightening as the\\nâ€˜nuclear winter.â€™ it could put a blanket of ashes and dust over\\nthe united states and other regions of the world. the good\\nnews is, an eruption of this large scale is unlikely to happen in\\n189\\nend of life on earth\\nour lifetime. yellowstone last erupted about 650,000 years ago,\\nand the united states geological survey says the probability of\\nit blowing its top again is minimal.\\nasteroid impact\\nthe word â€˜asteroidâ€™ means â€˜star-like.â€™ asteroids are those\\nmineralized space rocks, smaller than planets, that are mainly\\nfound in the asteroid belt rotating around the sun. not to get\\nconfused with comets that are made up of dust and ice. comets\\nremain icy as they orbit far away from the sun. if they get too\\nclose to the sun, its intense heat will melt them.\\nundoubtedly, asteroids are smaller than planets, but some are\\nbig enough to create destruction at a massive level if they hit\\nour planet. if a giant asteroid hit the landmass, there would be\\na tremendous amount of soil and dust particles thrown into\\nour atmosphere, resulting in air pollution and animal and plant\\nloss. it can be compared with the nuclear winter caused by\\nmany nuclear explosions. if an asteroid hits the oceans, there\\nwill be water vapor in the atmosphere, resulting in landslides\\nand destructive floods. there might be tsunamis, hurricanes,\\nand earthquakes in coastal regions due to the release of a large\\namount of energy.\\nhow to prevent an asteroid impact?\\nwe cannot prevent its destructive impact if we do not know\\nthe exact location of the asteroid. so, finding the exact position\\nof any threatening asteroid is the first and foremost thing\\nin preventing its destructive impact. today we have many\\nobservatories around the globe just for this work, which have\\ncalculated the trajectory of thousands of asteroids. after\\n190\\nbaby universe\\nfinding its position, the first option we have is to change its\\norbit so that it does not hit our planet. we are doing superbly\\nin locating and finding asteroids big enough to cause a global\\ndisaster. however, many attempts are yet to be made to locate\\nand find smaller asteroids which are threatening and capable\\nof a regional disaster.\\nasteroid destruction: we can use several techniques to destroy\\nan asteroid long before it reaches our planet. techniques like\\nnuclear disruption can be used for destruction. if we can\\ndestroy an asteroid in tiny pieces, we would not have to worry\\nabout it even if it comes our way. as those small pieces enter\\nour atmosphere, they will burn up long before reaching the\\nsurface. this technique can be used only in the case of small\\nasteroids. if a giant asteroid with a diameter of 1 kilometre\\nwas approaching earth, we should instead choose to change\\nits trajectory.\\ntarget change: to prevent small and regional disasters, we\\ncan change the hitting target of the asteroid. this could be\\none of the most effective and danger free techniques. suppose\\nthere is an asteroid, 1 billion kilometres away heading straight\\ntowards the earth. if we change its trajectory by just 1 meter,\\nit will make enough change over time that would prevent its\\ncrash with earth. by the time it travels 1 billion kilometres,\\nits trajectory would have been changed by hundreds of\\nthousands of kilometres.\\nhow many asteroids are there nearby?\\nmost of the asteroids are found orbiting within the asteroid\\nbelt located in between jupiter and mars. there are millions of\\nasteroids present in this belt. a small percentage of them are\\n191\\nend of life on earth\\nlarger than one kilometre in diameter whereas the majority are\\nsmaller ones. most of these asteroids come nowhere close to\\nour planet and orbit in the asteroid belt. those asteroids which\\ncross earthâ€™s orbital path are called earth-crossers. those who\\ncome close to our earth are called near-earth asteroids and\\nare estimated to be about 10,000 in number.\\nout of these, over 861 asteroids are thought to be larger\\nthan one kilometre, which can pose a significant threat. the\\ntotal number of asteroids that are potentially hazardous and\\ncould be threatening is around 1,400. apophis is a near-earth\\nasteroid with a diameter of 370 meters and an average orbital\\nspeed of 30 km/s. in december 2004, it caused a brief period\\nof concern because initial observations of scientists indicated\\na probability of up to 2.7% that it would strike earth on april\\n13th, 2029. this probability has come down significantly as we\\nare learning more about this asteroid.\\nwhat if apophis hits earth?\\non april 13th, 2029, apophis will pass very close to earth,\\nroughly 31,200 kilometres above earthâ€™s surface. it is\\ncalculated that it will most likely pass our planet. its bypass is\\nalmost safe, but if it goes in the wrong way and strikes earth,\\nthen the probability is that it would plunge into the pacific\\nocean, and the strike may spark a tsunami. apophis is not big\\nand threatening enough to cause extinction-level events for\\nentire humanity, but it is big enough to threaten many small\\ncountries. a sea or land strike would cause massive devastation\\nand could potentially kill millions of people. this asteroid is\\napproximately the same size as the empire state building. the\\nimpact of this asteroid would be equivalent to hundreds of\\n192\\nbaby universe\\nnuclear bombs being dropped at the same time.\\nhow often do large asteroids hit earth?\\nasteroids having a diameter of one kilometre or close to one\\nkilometre hit earth every 500,000 years on average. larger\\nasteroids having a diameter more than 5 km collide with earth\\napproximately once every twenty million years. even though\\nwe have observed many potentially hazardous asteroids, the\\nchance of them hitting our planet is significantly low. an\\nasteroid larger than 1 kilometre has almost zero chances of\\nhitting earth in our lifetime. astronomers have mapped out\\nthe trajectories and future near-earth fly-bys of almost all\\nknown big asteroids, so we are safe so far.\\n193\\nend of life on earth\\n194\\nbaby universe\\npart iv\\ndeath of the universe\\n195\\ndeath of the universe\\nhuman history tells us about the continuous evolution\\nhumanity has gone through. our present tells us\\nabout the path we are headed on for tomorrow.\\nhowever, the future does not speak. the future gives us no\\nevidence or information about the end of a journey that started\\n13.8 billion years ago with a giant explosion.\\ndifferent scientists predict our future differently, predicting\\na finite and even an infinite age of the universe. however,\\neveryone cannot be correct. the death of our universe is one of\\nthe significant subjects of discussion among scientists today. it\\nhas been a part of debates between some of the great minds for\\ndecades. from what we have learned so far, we can confidently\\nsay that the death of our universe comes under physical\\ncosmology and is directly affected by the role dark energy and\\ndark matter are playing and are going to play as the universe\\nages. it took 13.8 billion years for the universe to grow and\\nbecome what it is today.\\nwe all know one absolute rule of lifeâ€”everything comes to an\\nend. this rule not only applies to humanity, but our universe\\nalso falls under its strict restrictions. because one day, there will\\nbe no light to define the beauty of this endless dark.\\nthe fate of our universe not only includes the death of all the\\nstars, solar systems and giant galaxies, but also involves the\\ndeath of all life, including that on earth. it involves the death\\nof intelligence and the death of the consciousness that took\\nbillions of years to grow in the lap of the universe. we are lucky\\nthat we can understand ourselves, which tells us that we are\\nconscious. it makes it even more essential for us to understand\\nthe death of the universe because it means the death of all\\n196\\nbaby universe\\nthose efforts we have done to understand the nature of the\\nuniverse so far.\\nwhen our universe dies, history is going to be written again,\\nbut there will be no one to witness it. since edwin hubble\\npointed out that the galaxies are moving apart from each other,\\nthe cosmological era exploded, and various scientists predicted\\nthe fate of the universe. all the theories about the death of\\nthe universe are somehow related to what edwin hubble had\\npredicted, or better it can be said that most of those ideas are\\nthe by-product of what edwin hubble had figured out. now\\nlet us consider the different ways our universe could end:\\n197\\nbig freeze\\nbig freeze is also known as the â€˜future of the ever-expanding universe.â€™ it is one of the most accepted scenarios for the death of our universe. it is a scenario in which the universeâ€™s continuous expansion results in a universe that approaches absolute zero temperature. absolute zero is the minimum possible temperature of a body, taken as -273.15 â„ƒ and nothing can cool below this temperature. various scientific observations also suggest that this expansion of the universe will continue forever.\\ntoday we do not know what dark energy really is, but the idea of big freeze comes from what we have understood so far. as we know, the universe is going through a one-way expansion where dark energy is the leading force. we cannot control this expansion as it is beyond our grasp. so, the universe will continue to expand, but with the expansion, dark energy will get even more potent accelerating the expansion further. with this acceleration, the universe will expand so rapidly that some of the galaxies will break the light barrier and will never be seen again.\\nthere is a limited amount of gas and dust clouds in galaxies, which is needed to form new stars. in about 1 trillion years from now, no gas or dust clouds will remain as galaxies would have used them for the formation of new stars. as soon as the\\n198\\nbaby universe\\ngalaxies run out of gas and dust clouds, the formation of new\\nstars will end. at that point, there will be a finite number of\\nstars remaining in the universe. as we know, stars will not stay\\nthere forever, they have a limited lifetime due to the limited\\namount of fuel in them. so, at first, the more prominent stars\\nwill run out of fuel resulting in supernova explosions. after\\nthem, the smaller stars will run out of fuel, becoming white\\ndwarf stars. at this point, the universe will become dim, and a\\nlimited amount of heat and light will remain in the universe.\\nstars are the powerhouses that light up the entire universe.\\nin the absence of these stars, our universe will start cooling\\ndown rapidly. even the white dwarf stars themselves would\\nstart cooling down. they will get so cold that you would be\\nable to touch them with bare hands. the fusion activity at their\\ncore will stop entirely, and the core will also freeze. with no\\nnew source of heat and light, our entire universe will turn cold\\nand dark and reach an absolute zero temperature. black holes\\nwould still be there, but they are not a good source of heat\\nand light. the advanced civilizations (if any) would want to\\nget closer to the black holes and use their gravitational force\\nto generate heat and electricity. it would be difficult to survive\\nnear a black hole because they would have minimal resources.\\nthey might survive a few years with the leftover resources\\nbut not forever. almost all life in the universe will die at the\\nabsolute zero temperature, and no creature would be able to\\nmake it in the cold universe.\\nsome scientists suggest that gravity can prevent the expansion\\nof the universe caused by dark energy. however, there is not\\nenough matter in our universe that could overpower the\\nexpanding force of dark energy. matter makes up just 4.9% of\\n199\\nbig freeze\\nour observable universe due to which the overall strength of\\ngravity is weak. only a miracle can save our universe from this\\nexpansion. due to this weaker attractive gravitational force, the\\nstars will continue to move away from each other and galaxies\\nwill continue to drift apart from each other. this movement\\nwill only speed up with time.\\nmost scientists believe that the big freeze fate of the universe\\nis inevitable. no matter what we try and do, it will happen one\\nday. there is no known force in science which can stop this\\nexpansion. right now, research is going on about the nature\\nof dark energy. maybe as we learn more about the repulsive\\nnature of dark energy, we can find a way to prevent this fate of\\nthe universe. right now, there seems to be no hope for a future\\nthat is not as cold as absolute zero.\\n200\\nbig rip\\nbig rip is the extension of what we have learned in the big freeze death of the universe. big rip is a scenario in which the universe will keep on expanding and expand so rapidly that everything in the universe will be ripped apart and turn into pure energy. we see the fate of the universe in the form of big rip because dark energy overpowers gravity. the universe consists of just 4.9% matter, whereas the percentage of dark energy is 68.3.\\nas we know, the universe is expanding at an increasing rate. with this expansion, the strength of dark energy is increasing, causing even faster expansion. this theory states that the universe will keep expanding at a faster and faster rate. the big freeze theory states that galaxies will move apart, but the galaxies themselves will remain intact. however, the big rip theory suggests that the galaxies themselves will also expand, and this expansion of galaxies will only increase with time. all the stars that we see in the night sky are from the milky way galaxy, and all of them are within a few thousand light-years. as the expansion happens, nothing will remain in the night sky except for a few stars, which are also moving away from us and speeding up continuously.\\nalpha centauri, our nearest star, can be seen moving away from us but not for long because very soon it will break the light\\n201\\nbig rip\\nbarrier. everything in the universe will be pulled apart, even at\\nthe scale of solar systems. the distance between sun and earth\\nwill increase, and all the planets of our solar system will start\\nmoving away from each other. amazingly, this expansion will\\nact on an atomic scale as well. over the atomic scale, the atoms\\nwill swell. the distance between the electrons and the nucleus\\nwill increase. because of the continuous expansion, electrons\\nwill not be able to orbit the nucleus. protons and neutrons,\\nwhich make up the nucleus of an atom, will not be able to\\nhold each other together and will get pulled apart. protons and\\nneutrons will be dissipated into their constituents and will not\\nbe able to interact with each other anymore.\\nnow it is becoming horrifying because all of us are made up of\\natoms. when it happens, we would feel our body swelling and\\nthe length and width of our body increasing. of course, that\\nwould cause tremendous pain in our body. however, we will\\nnot be able to bear it for too long. our arteries will rupture, and\\nmost of our body organs will stop working when their atoms\\nget pulled apart. eventually, everything in the universe will rip\\napart and turn into pure energy, just like at the beginning of\\nthe universe.\\nif we see this expansion from the point of view of string\\ntheory, nothing will remain in the universe, except for the\\nvibrating strings. however, the strings themselves will be\\npulled in the ever-expanding universe, so only one type of\\nparticle will remain in the entire universe. this is scary, but it\\nseems to be possible when we consider the force of dark energy.\\nwhile dark energy is causing the expansion of the universe, it\\nis not only fighting with the attractive force of ordinary matter\\nbut also the attractive force of dark matter. if dark energy\\n202\\nbaby universe\\ncan successfully dominate over these two types of matter and\\naccelerate the expansion of the universe, it will have enough\\npower to rip us apart into pieces.\\nas predicted, the density of dark energy is increasing with\\ntime. with the increase in density, it is getting more powerful,\\ncausing a faster rate of expansion. as a result, all objects in the\\nuniverse, be it galaxies, solar systems, stars, or no matter how\\nsmall it is, will disintegrate into loose elementary particles and\\nradiation.\\nwhat will happen to the black holes?\\nit is interesting to see this fate of the universe from the point of\\nview of black holes. we have already talked about the hawking\\nradiations and how they slowly kill a black hole. all the black\\nholes, including the supermassive black holes, radiate energy\\nin the form of hawking radiations. with the expansion of the\\n203\\nbig rip\\nuniverse, the rate of hawking radiations will increase. as the\\nuniverse expands exponentially, black holes will get weaker\\nand weaker, and eventually radiate completely. however, this\\nprocess will take longer compared to the disintegration of\\nordinary matter. once a black hole has completely radiated\\naway, an un-curved and expanding space will remain at their\\nplace.\\n204\\nbig crunch\\nbig crunch is a bit different from what we have learned so far about the fate of the universe. it is the opposite of what we have discussed in the big freeze death of the universe. this theory assumes that the mean density of the universe is enough to stop the rate of expansion by overpowering the expansion caused by dark energy. according to this theory, the universe is expanding at an exponential rate due to the effects of the big bang, but as time passes, this expansion will slow down. as the expansion slows down, matter and dark matter will take over the force of dark energy, and the universe will begin contracting. as the contraction begins, the attractive gravitational force will dominate the universe.\\nbecause of this contraction, all the galaxies in the universe will start coming closer to each other. the universeâ€™s diameter will decrease, and matter will get closer. all the stars of our night sky would be seen becoming brighter and brighter. the planets of our solar system would come closer and closer to each other. the sun will become bigger and hotter every day, due to which earth will receive more heat, and all the oceans will evaporate. life as we know it will not be possible on this planet then.\\nall the galaxies, solar systems, stars, planets and everything else in the universe will come closer, and with time the rate of contraction will increase. with this increase in the rate of\\n205\\nbig crunch\\ncontraction, the universeâ€™s overall density will increase, and the\\namount of dark energy will decrease. eventually, the entire\\nuniverse will become a hot ball of plasma and collapse into\\na dimensionless singularity. gravity will pull everything back\\ntogether into one point again, as it has already been done\\nwith the previous form of our universe. the universe will get\\nsquashed together into a gigantic ball, and the big bang will\\nprobably occur once again!\\nthis theory allows the big bang to occur immediately after\\nthe big crunch of the preceding universe. this theory gives\\nus an idea for the series of formation, expansion, contraction,\\nand the big bang explosion with the universe. this idea\\nconstitutes a cyclic model of the universe, which is also known\\nas an oscillatory universe. if that is the case, our universe could\\nconsist of an infinite sequence of finite universes, with each\\nuniverse ending with a big crunch and resulting in a big bang\\nfor the formation of the next universe. this theory also answers\\nthe question of what existed before the big bang.\\ncurrent evidence indicates that the universe is not a closed\\nsystem. it has caused cosmologists to abandon the oscillating\\nuniverse model. big crunch will result in the heat death of the\\nuniverse which is totally against all of our current observations.\\ncurrent observations have shown that the rate of expansion\\nof the universe is neither slowing nor constant; instead, it is\\nincreasing with time, which only means that the power of dark\\nenergy is somehow increasing. with the increased power of\\ndark energy, there is no way that our universe will end up in\\nthe form of a big crunch. big freeze and big rip are the more\\nacceptable scenarios in todayâ€™s cosmology.\\n206\\nbaby universe\\nis there sufficient matter in the universe to slow its expansion?\\nno. there is not enough matter in the universe to slow this\\nexpansion. the amount of ordinary matter is less than 5\\npercent, whereas the amount of dark matter is around 27\\npercent. without the role of dark matter, this theory is not\\npossible, the combined percentage of matter and dark matter is\\nmuch lower than that of dark energy. something magical must\\nhappen to prevent the expansion of the universe, which makes\\nthis theory less valid.\\nbig bounce is another model of the universe that strongly\\nsupports the idea of big crunch. it suggests that this cyclic\\nmodel or oscillatory universe is possible. in this model, every\\nbig bang is the result of the collapse of a previous universe.\\nsome scientists predict that dark matter is not from our\\ndimensions; instead, it is a part of higher dimensions and is\\ncurrently leaking into our universe, causing its gravitational\\neffects. so, if a large sum of dark matter suddenly leaks into\\nour universe from higher dimensions, that could significantly\\nincrease the hold of gravity and make this scenario possible.\\napart from that, there is no hope for this particular fate of the\\n207\\nbig crunch\\nuniverse.\\nother fates\\neternal inflation: eternal inflation is the model of a\\nhypothetical inflationary universe. it is an extension of the big\\nbang theory. big bang successfully explained the birth of the\\nuniverse, but could not properly explain its fate. according to\\neternal inflation theory, our universe is like an inflating bubble.\\nall the matter in the universe, including our planet is on the\\nskin of the bubble. this bubble is expanding since the big bang\\nexplosion, and it will expand forever. there is no known force\\nin the universe that can stop this expansion.\\neternal inflation theory supports the big freeze model of the\\nuniverse, where our universe will eventually freeze to death.\\nhubbleâ€™s law also supports the future of the universe to be\\ninflationary, where inflation is going to lead us towards an\\nabsolute zero temperature. however, this theory contradicts\\nthe big rip model of the universe, where everything will fall\\napart into pieces. the expansion will never occur at the atomic\\nscale.\\nfalse vacuum: this theory points towards a vacuum consisting\\nof an unstable universe. in short, we all are floating over a\\nmassive wave in the universe, which is willing to acquire a state\\nof minimum potential. consider a bubble full of air. the air\\nis filled inside the bubble by an outside force, and the bubble\\nseems very stable. the air is not leaking out of the bubble, and\\nit is staying right where it is. however, that is not the reality.\\nin reality, this stability is only an illusion caused by the surface\\nthat holds the air and does not let it pass. if you pop the bubble,\\nthe air will come out and acquire a state of minimum potential,\\n208\\nbaby universe\\nwhich is equal to the atmospheric pressure in our case.\\nsome scientists believe that the universe we live in might not\\nhave reached its lowest and most stable potential yet. when\\nthat happens, it will end our entire universe. maybe we are still\\ninside the balloon, and if it pops, we will never see it coming.\\ntoday, we are here because dark matter played a significant\\nrole within our galaxies. when this fate of the universe occurs,\\nthe very fabric of space-time will fall apart into pieces. all the\\nknown forces of the universe will become obsolete and the\\nuniverse as we know it will end.\\nwhenever we talk about the fate of the universe, dark energy\\nseems to be the dominating factor. there are three different\\nscenarios explaining the fate of the universe, depending upon\\nthe probable role of dark matter.\\n1. the very first scenario is that there is enough dark matter to\\nprevent the expansion of the universe. one day, dark matter\\nand ordinary matter will take over dark energy. this scenario\\nis the same as the predictions made by the big crunch model\\nof the universe. if that is the case, our universe is definitely\\noscillatory; it comes and goes out of existence. in this scenario\\nour universe has a very limited age as compared to the big\\nfreeze and big rip model where the universe has an infinite\\nage, but the matter within does not.\\n2. another scenario is that at some point, dark matter, ordinary\\nmatter and dark energy will acquire a state of equilibrium.\\nafter a particular expansion, the universe will become static\\nas predicted by sir isaac newton. everything in the universe\\nwill come to a standstill. all the stars and galaxies that we see\\nmoving away from us will no longer do so. it supports the big freeze model of the universe because after a specific interval of\\ntime, stars will run out of energy.\\n3. the third model says that neither will dark matter and\\nordinary matter be able to overpower the force of dark energy,\\nnor will they be able to acquire a state of equilibrium. there\\nwill never be enough dark or ordinary matter that can compete\\nwith the force of dark energy. instead, as the universe ages, their\\noverall strength will reduce. the universe is expanding in one\\nway and will expand forever in the same way. this model puts\\nbeauty in the big rip model, where this force will dominate\\nnot only the galaxies but also the fundamental particles.\\n\\nabsolute zero: the lowest possible temperature of a body; its value is -273.15 â„ƒ. the value of the heat energy of a body reduces to zero at the absolute zero temperature.\\nanti-gravity: just opposite to gravity. anti-gravity (in the form of dark energy) is causing the expansion of the universe by pushing galaxies apart.\\nantimatter: antimatter is opposite to ordinary matter. anti-protons have a negative charge and anti-electrons have a positive charge. matter and its antimatter consume each other as they come in contact leaving behind pure energy and radiations. every single particle is supposed to have an antiparticle.\\natom: the most basic unit of matter. it consists of a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons surrounded by moving electrons.\\nbig bang: the most successful theory in explaining the origin of the universe. evidence shows that this colossal explosion occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago. the universe was nothing but a singularity before the big bang.\\nbig crunch: scenario explaining the fate of the universe in which gravity will take over the expanding forces of dark energy. the whole universe will turn into a singularity, and the\\n215\\nglossary\\nbig bang will occur once again.\\nbig freeze: this theory suggests that the expansion of the\\nuniverse will last forever. stars will use up all their energy, black\\nholes will radiate away, and intelligent life will die at absolute\\nzero temperature.\\nbig rip: this theory suggests that everything in the universe\\nwill be ripped apart due to the expanding universe. nearby\\ngalaxies will break the light barrier, and all the matter in the\\nuniverse will be ripped apart into its constituents.\\nblack hole: a region in the space where gravity is strong\\nenough that even light cannot escape. the escape velocity of\\nany black hole is higher than the speed of light, which is\\nimpossible to achieve.\\nblue shift: blue shift arises due to the shrinking of space. if a\\nyellow star is heading towards us at high speed, it will appear\\nblue in the telescope.\\nchandrasekhar limit: the maximum possible mass of an\\nobject above which it turns into a black hole.\\nconservation law: this law predicts that energy can neither\\nbe created nor destroyed. as per given by e=mc2, equivalent\\nmass and energy are convertible into each other.\\ncosmic microwave background: the leftover afterglow or\\nfootprints of the big bang explosion in the form of radiations.\\ncosmological constant: extra term einstein used in his\\nequations, giving a static model of the universe. later he\\nremoved this term after the discovery of the expanding universe.\\ncosmology: the study of the universe starting from its\\n216\\nbaby universe\\nbeginning until its end.\\ncritical density: the average density of matter at which the\\nuniverse will halt its expansion. the universe is not very dense\\ndue to which dark energy has taken over.\\ndark energy: an unknown form of energy of space which\\nconstitutes 68.3% of the total universe. dark energy causes\\nthe one-way expansion of the universe by overcoming the\\ngravitational pull.\\ndark matter: an unknown form of matter, constitutes 27% of\\nthe total universe. not only ordinary matter, but dark matter\\nis also equally responsible for holding our galaxies together. its\\npresence is measured by the distortion it creates in the path of\\nlight.\\ndimension: the primary parameter to measure space and time.\\nelectromagnetic force: it is one of the four fundamental forces\\nof nature. it is the force of

model of a hypothetically\\ninflationary universe.\\nevent horizon: a one-way ticket to a black hole. the\\nboundary, after which nothing can escape from the black\\nhole, not even light.\\n217\\nglossary\\nlaser: light amplification by stimulated emission of\\nradiation. laser produces a highly monochromatic, coherent,\\nand concentrated beam of light.\\nfalse vacuum: vacuum that has not yet acquired the lowest\\nenergy state. in the case of a supernova, the whole star\\nexplodes and acquires the state of minimum energy. similarly,\\nthe transition of a false vacuum into a true vacuum may occur\\nat any time, which may lead to the end of our universe.\\nfrequency: the number of vibrations or the number of cycles\\nper second.\\nfusion: process in which elements fuse into each other\\nresulting in the formation of a new element. this process\\nis mostly exothermic, which means energy is released. new\\nelement generated is different in composition to that of its\\nconstituents. for example, the fusion of hydrogen nuclei forms\\nhelium in the core of a star.\\ngalaxy: the elliptical/spiral/irregular beauty of the universe.\\ngalaxies consist of billions of stars and planets. our galaxy is\\nthe milky way galaxy which is made up of 100 to 400 billion\\nstars.\\ngeneral relativity: it is one of the most successful theories\\ngiven by albert einstein in 1916. it successfully explained the\\ngravitational force in terms of the bending of space-time.\\ngod: the real creator and the ruler of the entire universe.\\ngrand unification theory (gut): a theory that could unify\\nelectromagnetism and nuclear forces. gut theory does not\\ninvolve the unification of all four fundamental forces of nature.\\n218\\nbaby universe\\ngravitation: the weakest force of nature that keeps us on the\\nground. einstein predicted that space pushes us towards the\\nground, instead of the earth pulling us.\\nhawking radiation: radiation caused by the black holes,\\nresulting in their evaporation. more massive black hole results\\nin more hawking radiations and vice versa.\\nhiggs boson: a particle that gives matter its mass.\\nhiggs field: a field that swept across the entire universe just\\nafter the big bang, which gave particles their mass.\\nhubbleâ€™s law: after the observation of distant galaxies for a\\nlong time, hubble predicted that the farther galaxies are, the\\nfaster they are moving away from us. their distance from us\\nis directly proportional to the rate at which they are moving\\naway.\\nlarge hadron collider: a landmark human achievement. it\\nhas enabled us to look deeper into the microscopic universe\\ninside an atom. lhc uses a high energy beam of photons and\\ncollides them to learn more about them.\\nlight: electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths.\\nlight year: one light-year is the distance travelled by a light\\nbeam in a year. this parameter is used to measure the vast\\ndistances, such as the distant stars and galaxies.\\nmagnetic field: field generated by the charged particles when\\nthey are in motion, responsible for the magnetic interactions.\\nmass: the amount of matter in a body.\\nmatter: it is made up of atoms and molecules. everything\\naround you that you can touch or see around you is an ordinary\\n219\\nglossary\\nmatter.\\nmultiverse: the idea of multiple

particle with a mass of 1.672ã—10-\\n27 kg. along with protons, it makes up the atomic nuclei.\\nneutron star: as a result of a supernova explosion, these\\nsmallest and densest stars are born. a

subatomic particles are studied in\\nquantum mechanics.\\nquarks: the elementary particles which make protons and\\nneutrons. three individual quarks make up a proton or a\\n220\\nbaby universe\\nneutron.\\nradioactivity: the natural disintegration of some elements. in\\nthis process, the nucleus ultimately breaks into daughter nuclei.\\nthe rate of radioactivity depends upon the type of matter.\\nred shift: just opposite of blue shift. the wavelength of light\\nwave emitted by a distant source moves toward the red end of\\nthe electromagnetic spectrum because of the expanding fabric\\nof space and time.\\nsingularity: a point of infinite density. in the beginning,\\na singularity exploded and created our universe. generally,\\nsingularities are found at the centre of a

in 1905.\\nsteady-state theory: this theory raises the question of the\\nexistence of the big bang. the basic idea is that the universe\\nhas always existed and will always exist; the formation of stars\\nand galaxies is a continuous process.\\nstring theory: theory that goes deeper into our atomic and\\nsubatomic particles, suggesting the presence of one-dimensional\\nstrings whose different vibrations cause the different particles.\\nstrong nuclear forces: the strongest of four fundamental\\nforces which hold the protons and neutrons inside an atom.\\n221\\nglossary\\nsupernova: a short event in which a star produces an enormous\\namount of energy because of its explosion.\\ntime: it is the continuous progress of the existence of events.\\ntime is irreversible, and it takes us from

within the universes.\\nx-rays: a type of electromagnetic radiation. x-rays have a\\nwavelength of 0.01-10 nanometres.\\n223\\nwho is god?\\nthe question â€˜who is god?â€™ is a valid question in science, so finding the correct answer becomes our responsibility. earlier it was believed that whatever is happening above the sky is a divine act of god, and it would be a sin to go there and find out. however, not everyone believed this to be true. some men stood for themselves and questioned the existence of god even though they might fear that if there is a god, they will go straight to hell. the curiosity, even to question the existence of god, has helped us in making various advancements in science. if no one had questioned godâ€™s existence, then there would be no agnostics, atheists and spiritual people.\\nthere is a notable misconception that most of the scientists believe in god, and so there must be a god. well, scientists do not use god or holy books such as the bible, qurâ€™an, or gita for their scientific research. they use these books for their spiritual enlightenment when it comes to research religion has no role to play in it. when i see so much suffering in the outside world, people dying in floods while others die in droughts without water, i want to question the existence of a personal god above the clouds. if god cares about us, then why doesnâ€™t he/she/it stop these natural disasters. maybe god does not care about natural human suffering, or maybe god does\\n224\\nbaby universe\\nnot even exist.\\nfrom my understanding so far about religion and people in\\ngeneral. there are three types of gods:\\nthe personal god\\nthe very first god is the personal god. humans have created\\nthis personal god in the form of statues. he listens to us, and\\nyou can spend hours in front of him. he is so attentive that he\\nwill not even blink his eyes while listening to you. people like\\nto share their daily life problems with this god. they go and\\nsit in front of its statue and spell out everything that has been\\nbothering them for days. they cannot discuss it with anyone\\nelse because they feel very insecure about it, so instead, they\\nchoose to tell god.\\nsuppose today you are going for an interview; you stop midway\\nand pray to god to get this job. if you do well in the interview\\nand get the job, you will give credit to god. however, if you\\ncould not answer the questions during the interview and do\\nnot get the job, this time, you will blame yourself and not god.\\nthat is how the peopleâ€™s relation with personal god works.\\nthis god never replies, never takes the food or stuff that they\\nbring to temples or churches, but somehow people feel pleased\\nafter bowing down in front of this god.\\nif i had to give another name for the personal god, then it\\nwould be the psychological god because personal god is\\nall about how we feel after doing our prayers. people spend\\nthousands of dollars to go to a psychologist, and what does\\na psychologist do? he/she listens. you go there, spill out\\neverything in your heart, and that makes you feel better about\\n225\\nwho is god?\\nyourself. because now you know that there is someone who\\nknows about my problems. the same thing happens in the\\nchurches, mosques and temples. you get inner psychological\\nrelief after offering prayers.\\nthe only problem with the personal god is that different\\npeople with different religious backgrounds have different gods.\\nthis distinction creates differences between various groups\\nof society, which sometimes becomes the reason for feuds\\nbetween them. once you attach yourself to a personal god, you\\nlose your human identity. now you do whatever is possible to\\nprotect your religious identity even if it means killing other\\nfellow humans. more people have died or killed other people\\nin the name of personal god than killed by natural disasters.\\nour history is full of bloodbath caused by religious tension.\\neven today religious tension can be seen in countries which\\nare diverse with people from different religious backgrounds\\nliving there.\\nthe universal god\\nthe second kind of god is that which most of the spiritual\\npeople and atheists believe in. the god of fundamental forces\\nof nature that governs the entire universe. the forces which\\ncreated us and the forces within us that keep us alive. this god\\ndoes not care about our paychecks, bills, rent, fees and daily life\\nworries. this god says that instead of begging in front of me,\\nfigure out the way by yourself. i like this idea of god because\\nit gives you a universal identity. once you believe in a universal\\ngod, you consider all the other fellow humans as one, and you\\nwould do anything possible to protect and help others. not\\nonly humans, you consider the entire universe as one, and you\\n226\\nbaby universe\\ncan feel the presence of the universe within yourself.\\njust like the personal god, people who believe in a universal\\ngod attach themselves to something which creates a distinction\\nbetween them and other religious people. accepting a universal\\nidentity for someone who believes in a personal god is difficult\\nbecause if they do so, they would have to erase everything\\ntaught to them since childhood. however, with enough\\nknowledge and curiosity in mind, religious people can turn\\ninto spiritualists or atheists.\\nfundamental forces of nature are equal for everyone, it does\\nnot matter what your religion, caste, or gender is. while\\nworshippers of personal god might limit themselves to a\\ncertain level, a person who believes in the universal god is not\\nonly a good human being but also willing to accept new ideas\\nand thoughts. this is what a progressive mind is, it accepts the\\nnew reality. acceptance of new ideas and thoughts is needed,\\nespecially if you want to go in the field of science and do some\\nresearch. believing in a personal god comes with a boundary\\nand a set of rules which make you feel calm and safe within\\nyour head. which is another reason why most religious people\\ndo not want to leave their religion even if they know something\\nis not right.\\nthe god of simulations\\nthe third possibility is that we are living in a simulation, and\\nwhoever created this simulation is our god. we will probably\\nnever know about it because it is too smart for us to comprehend.\\njust like a player in a game would never know that it is being\\ncontrolled by someone else with a higher intelligence, we also\\nmight never find out. the player in the game might think that\\n227\\nwho is god?\\nhe is making his own conscious decisions, but he does not\\nknow that a joystick is controlling him. as he moves in the\\ngame, buildings and roads get created within his frame of view.\\neven if the player in the game knows that his decisions are not\\nhis own, he cannot do anything about it. he must obey the\\ncommands given by the program.\\nif we are living in a simulation, then it is possible that those\\nwho created us are also living in a simulation. which means\\nour god could have its own god as well. this creates a long\\nchain of simulations with infinite gods, one above the other.\\nthis possibility further raises the question of how big this\\nchain is and where does it end. does it end at infinity, or is\\nit like a circle where multiple simulations depend upon each\\nother? if we are living in a simulation which is not circular,\\nthen there are two possibilities.\\nthe first possibility is that we are the first in this chain of\\nsimulations, and the other simulations have not started yet.\\nwe will create further simulations in the future that will make\\nus into a kind of god for the coming simulations. if we are\\nthe first one, it also means that there is no god above us. the\\nsecond probability is that we are living in a chain of infinite\\nsimulations, and we are the latest simulation that has been\\ncreated. there are no simulations after us because we are the\\nones who will continue this series.\\nso how do we find out if we are living in a simulation? well,\\nthe easy way is to figure out if free will is our choice. if all the\\ndecisions that we are taking are indeed our own and there is no\\nconnection between two simultaneous events, then it might be\\ntrue that we are not living in a simulation. it is hard to find out\\n228\\nbaby universe\\nbecause we have no way of knowing if our actions are our own\\nand whether free will is actually free. let us suppose we are\\nliving in a simulation and trying to find out if free will is real.\\nthen would the god who created this simulation ever allow us\\nto figure this out? think about it.\\n229\\ndoes the universe have a purpose?\\nwe have created milestones in the history of humanity, but we are still confused if there is a purpose to all that. this question has been bothering us long before we started understanding the language of the universe. in the pursuit of finding a purpose, we have created our own different personal gods. our understanding about god might have changed in the last 1000 years, but we are still clueless if the universe has a purpose. the meaning of purpose is the reason for which something was created or for which something exists. when we look deeper into the universe, we do not seem to find a reason for the existence of the cosmos. maybe it was created for a reason, but it is too complicated for us to find out. whenever we talk about the purpose of the universe, scientists have two different opinions:\\nthe first group of scientists believe that the universe has a purpose. these scientists believe in godâ€™s existence; some believe in the personal god, whereas others believe in the universal god as most of them are spiritual. moreover, the god who created all of us must have a plan of why he created us. the universe has a purpose because lives, from their very first spark, are governed by various laws of nature which drive\\n230\\nbaby universe\\nus towards our fate. all those events of the past where life\\ncame out of water and became what it is today cannot be a\\nmere coincidence. if we look at the geometry of the universe\\nfrom an atom to the solar system and the giant galaxies, we\\nfind a similar pattern. laws of the universes are governing our\\nlives, and we must be thankful for that. in the end, maybe a\\nbillion years from now, we will find the purpose, and even if\\nwe do not, we must keep giving ourselves new purposes in the\\nform of small tasks and keep this cycle going.\\nthe second group believes that the universe does not have a\\npurpose because we do not play a central role in the universe.\\nwe are tiny creatures living on a small planet, circling an\\naverage-sized star, in an average-sized galaxy somewhere in\\nthe universe. if we see our role in the universe, then we will\\nfind that we do not matter to the cosmos. the universe will\\ngo on its way as it is now whether we are present or not. there\\nare universal forces inside us that support and nourish life, but\\nthere are an equal amount of forces that are trying to kill us.\\nevery day people are dying due to all sorts of silly reasons. that\\nmakes us worthless for the universe.\\nevery second the universe is growing and moving towards its\\nfate. maybe in a 100 billion years maybe in a 1 trillion years\\nfrom now, the universe will die out, so what is the meaning of\\nour existence? a universe without purpose does not mean that\\nour lives are purposeless because we create our own purposes,\\nbut it also means that we do not have a purpose or role to\\nplay in the universe. the universe having a purpose is only\\ntheoretical; they are the predictions of religious people trying\\nto conflict with science. for people who believe in religion,\\nreligion gives them a purpose to serve a god, go to heaven and\\n231\\ndoes the universe have a purpose?\\nlive forever. however, science says it is false because there is no\\nevidence of god. it is hard to say that religion holds the truth\\nabout our purpose because science brings the question against\\ngod, stating who created god itself?\\nin simple words, our predictions of whether we have a purpose\\nor not are just theoretical foundations without a solid base. we\\nare struggling to find our place in the universe, and it is even\\nharder to predict our purpose. either one of the above sides is\\ncorrect, or both could be wrong. the search for a purpose creates\\na purpose in itself. however, if the universe does not have a\\npurpose, and it is going to die anyway, it makes everything\\nmeaningless. giving ourselves a purpose each day and going\\nthrough a continuous state of evolution may lead us towards an\\nultimate purpose. life starts and ultimately ends, then it starts\\nagain but not from where it ended, and the process goes on.\\nit is hard for science to say whether we have a purpose or not.\\nscience goes through evolution itself.\\nreligion sends us to heaven or hell based upon the acts we\\ndo while being alive. religion gives us a purpose even after\\ndeath which is something science does not allow. we must not\\nforget that while science has proved religion to be wrong, there\\nare many questions that science still cannot answer. a purpose\\ncannot be multiple because the ultimate purpose is singular. if\\nthe universe has a purpose, then it is unlikely we have a role to\\nplay in it.\\nthere are various questions in our path. does intelligence and\\nconsciousness lead us towards a destiny? do we have a role to\\nplay in the universe? or is it just a meaningless race to save\\nhumanity that will inevitably end somehow, someday, in some\\n232\\nbaby universe\\nother place, in some other form? maybe yes or maybe no!\\nif there is no purpose, then it becomes our responsibility to\\ngive ourselves one. if there is a purpose where we have a role\\nto play, we must try and uncover it as soon as possible. today\\nonly religion can answer this question with confidence, but we\\nmust not forget, â€˜religion cannot show it and science cannot\\nprove it today.â€™\\n233\\nnewtonâ€™s world\\na true physicist, mathematician, astronomer and natural philosopher, sir isaac newton is considered as one of the most influential scientists ever lived on this planet. born on december 25th, 1642, in woolsthorpe, england, sir isaac newton is commonly known for discovering the universal law of gravitation. sir newton was born the same year galileo galilei died. during his childhood, sir isaac newton was not a good student at all. after his stepfather died, his mother wanted him to become a farmer. but little newton was not good at farming, so he was sent back to school. if he were good at farming, he would have stayed at home, and it would take probably another hundred years for scientists to discover gravity. when he was 22, newton developed the generalized binomial theorem. after graduation, newton spent the next two years at home developing his theories on optics, calculus and his universal laws on gravitation.\\nit is said that during the great plague of london, which lasted from 1665 to 1666, newton discovered the laws of gravitation. quarantine at home gave him time to work on his theories and to develop new laws. if the plague had not happened, we might have missed some of the most significant works of sir isaac newton. a few months after getting his undergraduate degree at 23 years of age, newton went back to his family farm. that\\n234\\nbaby universe\\nplace was far away from the dangers of the plague, which was\\ntaking several lives. a farm provided him a quiet and relaxed\\nplace to work upon his ideas and discover new rules of the\\nworking universe.\\naccording to a famous story, newton saw an apple falling from\\na tree, which gave him his idea of gravitation. he suggested\\nthat the same force which caused the apple to fall to earth is\\ncausing us to stay on the surface of earth. moreover, the same\\nforce might also be dominating the movement of planets in\\nthe solar system. newton always believed that nature follows\\ncertain laws; he used mathematics to prove the existence of\\ngravity. a force that keeps planets in their orbits around the\\nsun, it also causes objects to fall towards earth. finally, we\\ncan say that an apple served humanity by falling in front of\\nnewton. isaac newtonâ€™s discovery of gravity was significant\\n235\\nnewtonâ€™s world\\nbecause it gave us a better understanding of mechanics. better\\nmechanics have completely revolutionized our daily lives, and\\nthe industrial revolution was also impacted. if there were no\\ngravity on earth, all of us would be flying in outer space at\\n1000 miles per hour.\\nin optics, newtonâ€™s discovery of the composition of white light\\nhelped us understand the nature of light. newton showed the\\nworld that white light is composed of several rays of diverse\\ncolours. this discovery became the foundation of the modern\\noptics we study today. now light was no longer thought to be\\nhomogeneous and straightforward since newton was the first\\nperson to reveal its complexity.\\nin mechanics, newtonâ€™s three laws of motion became the\\nfoundation of modern mechanics. astronauts in the zerogravity\\nof space, space shuttles, revolving planets and their\\nmoons, moving stars and even galaxies obey these fundamental\\nprinciples observed by newton. he derived keplerâ€™s laws for\\nplanetary motion using his mathematical descriptions and\\nfinally predicted the trajectories of various small objects in the\\nsolar system. with the help of the explanation of newton and\\nhis works, we get the final picture of our working solar system.\\neven today, we are using the same laws to send astronauts into\\nspace and to observe the orbits of various planets around the\\nsun. these three laws are:\\n1. all the bodies want to stay in their present state unless acted\\nupon by an external force.\\n2. the rate of change of momentum in a body is directly\\nproportional to the applied force.\\n236\\nbaby universe\\n3. for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\\nin mathematics, newton discovered one of the most beautiful\\nand complex riddles, calculus. today, scientists use calculus\\nto understand the language of the universe. the story for the\\ninvention of calculus is very motivating. while newton was\\nworking on the theory of gravity, he found that the existing\\nlaws of mathematics were very limited in explaining his ideas\\non gravitation. so instead of getting demotivated and giving\\nup on his calculations, he invented calculus. now the principles\\nof calculus were able to explain gravity successfully. calculus is\\nthe backbone for a large number of theories and predictions\\nwe make about the universe. in short, calculus has become\\nthe backbone for most of mathematics. it is said that newton\\ninvented calculus at the same rate a high school student learns\\nit in school.\\nbefore newton, no one knew what caused the tides at sea. it\\nwas a mystery. however, with the discovery of gravitation\\nand after creating a complete model of how gravity works,\\nnewton was able to explain sea tides. newton explained how\\nthe gravitational pull from the sun and the moon affects tides\\non earth. what newton said about the working of tides over\\n350 years ago still applies. he did not just have ideas to explain\\nthe working of tides, but he also proved them mathematically,\\nwhich is more important.\\nthe telescope was first invented over 400 years ago, but\\ntelescopes at that time were not very productive. they could\\nonly magnify an image by a few times. it was almost impossible\\nto see distant objects clearly with those telescopes. in 1668, this\\ngenius invented the reflecting telescope. with the discovery of\\n237\\nnewtonâ€™s world\\nthe reflecting telescope, the space race got a major boost. by\\nusing large mirrors, we were able to focus the beam of light\\ncoming from distant stars onto a single point. whenever you\\nsee equations of mathematics, space shuttles heading towards\\nthe orbit, or beautiful pictures taken by your camera, do not\\nforget to thank the genius who shaped our world into a better\\nplace when it was much needed. some of the most significant\\nachievements of sir isaac newton are:\\n1. discovery of gravity.\\n2. explained the nature and properties of light.\\n4. developed the newtonian telescope.\\n5. invention of calculus.\\n6. he gave the three laws of motion.\\nthe picture of the universe has gone through continuous\\nvariation with time. at the time of newton, most of the\\nthings we now know about the universe were unknown yet.\\nso, newton gave his unique model of the universe. for sir\\nnewton, both space and time were different concepts having\\nno relation with each other. newton suggested the existence\\nof an ether in his book â€œthe third book of opticksâ€ (1718).\\nwith his observations of the universe, newton came up with\\nthese conclusions:\\n1. the universe is a static place composed of an infinite number\\nof stars scattered randomly throughout its volume.\\n2. the universe is infinitely old, it has existed forever and will\\nexist forever without any significant changes.\\n3. space and time are steady and independent of one another;\\n238\\nbaby universe\\nobjects exist within them.\\neven though albert einstein later proved most of his ideas\\nabout space and time to be wrong, it was nonetheless a good\\nstart by newton. albert einstein built upon the basis of what\\nisaac newton said and gave a different picture of the universe.\\nalmost nothing was known about the universe when newton\\ngave these conclusions. also, there was no research done in\\nspace. so, by only observing from earth, it was natural for him\\nto conclude that the universe consists of an infinite number of\\nstars. there was no big bang theory or cmbr model of the\\nuniverse, so people believed that the universe is infinitely old.\\nthe ether hypothesis\\nthe wave theory of light says that light requires a medium for\\nits propagation. newton believed that the entire universe was\\nfilled with an ideal medium called ether. ether was supposed\\nto be roughly massless, invisible with infinitely low density.\\nether provided a rest frame for the propagation of light. the\\nhigh value of elasticity and very low density enabled light to\\npropagate through this medium without losing its intensity.\\nnot only light, but this ideal medium also enables all the other\\nelectromagnetic waves to travel through the entire space.\\nto check the existence of ether, one of the most significant\\nand long-lasting experiments in human history was carried\\nout; the name of this experiment was the michelson-morley\\nexperiment. the basic idea of this experiment was to calculate\\nthe relative motion of light with respect to earth. if there was\\na medium called ether in the space with a low density, then\\nthere must be a relative motion. as a result of this experiment,\\nno relative motion between earth and ether was detected,\\n239\\nnewtonâ€™s world\\nresulting in a universe that does not contain ether and is a\\ncomplete vacuum. this experiment took michelson towards\\nthe nobel prize in physics in 1907.\\nnewtonâ€™s ideas dominated physics for three centuries until\\nalbert einstein modified them through his work in the\\nâ€˜theory of relativity.â€™ newton gave his scientific ideas much\\nbefore einstein when most of the actual physics was unknown.\\nthe laws given by newton can still be found in different areas\\nof mechanics, optics and mathematics. he took a rest from his\\nimmensely productive and motivating journey on march 20th,\\n1726, at the age of 84.\\n240\\neinsteinâ€™s relativity\\nborn on march 14th, 1879, albert einstein is considered as the greatest and most revolutionary scientist to ever live. the â€˜man of the centuryâ€™ has done lots of spectacular work in the field of physics. his contribution by developing the special and general theory of relativity gave him the title of the father of modern physics. his theory explained the relativity of time, space, energy, gravity, etc. and these predictions that were later verified experimentally caused immeasurable change to the world. the worldâ€™s most famous equation e=mc2 on which atomic and nuclear bombs are based came from the scientific work of albert einstein.\\nas one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, einsteinâ€™s special theory of relativity revolutionized physics and challenged scientists worldwide. his research made him a celebrity, not to mention his flirtatious behaviour that could impress any woman. this genius was awarded the nobel prize in 1921 for his exceptional work in physics, especially for his discovery of the photoelectric effect. he took rest from his revolutionary journey on april 18th, 1955, in princeton.\\neinstein studied the equations given by maxwell on light and predicted that the speed of light is invariant. the invariant speed of light breaks newtonâ€™s laws, but it was accepted since newton gave no evidence against the variable speed of\\n241\\neinsteinâ€™s relativity\\nlight. 1905 is considered as a miracle year in the life of albert\\neinstein. this is the year in which he published four research\\npapers, and each of these papers became the foundation for\\ncoming discoveries in physics. these research papers included\\nthe special relativity and well-known equation e=mcâ².\\nput your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like\\nan hour. sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a\\nminute. that is relativity. ~albert einstein\\nwhen einstein first published his research papers, most of his\\nwork was ignored by the physicists because there was no physical\\nevidence for what he said. publishing a series of papers from\\n1905 to 1915, he spent ten years finishing what he started. in\\n1915, he completed one of the most significant theories of all\\ntime, general relativity. he was confident with his work and\\nwhat he said because the mathematical beauty of the universe\\nreflected in his equations. year 1919 changed the life of albert\\neinstein once and for all and made him a celebrity worldwide\\n242\\nbaby universe\\nas the results from the observations of a solar eclipse were\\nshown. the results were revolutionary because they threw out\\nnewtonâ€™s ideas. he became world-famous within days when\\nscientists experimentally found that light bends when it passes\\nnear a planet. this was the moment when physicists started\\nstudying his work and took his ideas seriously.\\neinstein used the quantum theory of light and explained the\\nphotoelectric effect. he explained light not as a wave but as a\\nbeam of particles called photons. the electrons absorb these\\nphotons in an atom which excites them and gives rise to the\\nphotoelectric current. this gave rise to another rivalry between\\nthe great minds because light was considered as a wave, and\\neinstein successfully explained it as a beam consisting of\\nparticles. by the time the rivalry ended, light had acquired a\\ndual nature. well, light did not acquire any nature, its nature\\nwas accepted to be dual. phenomenon like interference,\\ndiffraction, and polarization show that light is a wave, whereas\\nthe photoelectric effect and black body radiation show its\\nparticle nature. today we have solar panels as a result of the\\ndiscovery of the photoelectric effect.\\nthe world that einstein articulated has become our world\\ntoday. the map of the universe given by einstein has become\\nthe foundation for astronomy. today we are using the same\\nequations and moving along with the same ideas einstein left\\nfor us. today relativity has become the backbone for modern\\nphysics and cosmology. relativity is not just a theory, it is a way,\\na path shown by albert einstein to the entirety of humanity to\\nunfold the infinite secrets hidden in the universe.\\n243\\neinsteinâ€™s relativity\\ngravitation\\nâ€˜matter tells space how to curve; space tells matter how to\\nmove.â€™ ~albert einstein.\\naccording to albert einstein, space is like a 4-dimensional\\nfabric consisting of both space and time. mass of planets or\\nany object distorts the fabric, gathering other objects around\\nthem. this distortion in the fabric of space-time is known as\\nthe â€˜bending of space-time,â€™ and creates the effect we experience\\nas gravity. einstein predicted that space and time are like two\\nfaces of the same coin. einstein explains that if you are sitting\\non a chair, earth is not attracting you towards the chair, but it\\nis the distortion in space forcing you to stay there.\\nas newton predicted, space and time are the static stage on\\nwhich physical processes act; einstein explained space-time as\\nan active player working in tandem. space-time can be curved,\\nit expands as well as shrinks depending on the amount and\\nnature of matter. earthâ€™s mass causes more distortion than what\\nthe moon does; as a result, the moon orbits earth. like other\\nnatural satellites, the moon also wants to fall into earth, but\\nbecause of equal centripetal force, it stays in its orbit. however,\\nresearchers have found that the moon is moving away from\\nthe earth at a rate of roughly 4 cm per year.\\ne=mc2\\nthe next time you walk on the street, ask anyone to tell you\\nan equation given by albert einstein. either they will not\\nhave any answer, or the words coming out will be e=mc2. this\\nis the most famous equation ever written by anyone. in the\\nbeginning, it was hard to believe the accuracy of this equation\\n244\\nbaby universe\\nbecause â€˜câ€™ (speed of light-299,792,458 meters per second) itself\\nis a large number, which means 2 kilograms of mass converts\\ninto energy equivalent to 42 million tons of tnt. however, as\\nwe understood the structure of an atom and their radioactive\\nnature, we realized the importance of this equation.\\nthis equation is popularly known as the â€˜mass-energy\\nequivalence.â€™ if energy can be converted directly into mass,\\nthen mass can also be converted into energy. this equation\\nsuccessfully explained that mass is just another form of energy,\\nand both are convertible into each other. nuclear weapons\\nand atomic bombs are the by-product of this equation. not\\nonly nuclear bombs, but nuclear reactors also work on the\\nsame principle and produce electricity for a large part of\\nthe population. this equation explains how every star in the\\nuniverse, including our sun, fuse atoms and release an enormous\\namount of energy. without this equation, there would be no\\nnuclear bombs, and there would be no nuclear reactors as well.\\n245\\nthe conclusion\\nevolution is necessary, even in our daily lives. if you are not evolving continuously, you are not living life. in the end, even our universe will fade away or die out like all of us. however, the fate of the universe only means the end of one chapter, it will find its way back, maybe in other shapes or forms. being a tiny creature sitting in a home on this planet might make you feel small, but remember that you are the part of this universe.\\ninstead of feeling small, feel big for playing your role in this endless cosmos. how our intelligence and consciousness has enabled us to find a meaning to the universe is magical and cannot be explained in words, it can only be felt. it is possible that there could be many distinct universes where there are no signs of consciousness, or there could be many in which there are. if it is not, then it becomes our duty to find them and give them a meaning.\\nour view of the universe was different just ten years ago, and iâ€™m sure it will be quite different ten years hence. universe will continue to make us wonder, and the day it stops doing so, we are doing something wrong. we must look back into the past and start a new journey. today we know so much about the universe because we are standing on the shoulder of giants such as sir isaac newton and albert einstein. their teachings\\n246\\nbaby universe\\nstand right in the middle of our understanding about the\\nuniverse. today we have limited knowledge available to argue\\nsome of the biggest questions arisen through this book, but we\\ncan wait and see how science will shape and further resolve\\nthese riddles. everything we have studied so far is nothing but\\nsimple details that will one day lead us towards the ultimate\\ntruth; there is a whole lot of universe waiting to be known.\\nas a kid, i have always looked up to many scientists and thinkers\\nwho helped me understand what little i knew. professor\\nstephen hawking, sir michio kaku and sir neil degrasse\\ntyson are some of them. whatever i learned from them since\\nchildhood, i have poured out in this book. studying their\\nwork and watching them has made me realize how little we\\nknow about the universe. what surprises me the most about\\nscience is the way it has taught me how different the world\\nis from what was taught by my grandmother in her tales. i\\nappreciate the way science can further change it with our little\\nand continuous efforts.\\nthe universe without us is not a universe, it is nothing because\\nthere is no one to understand its language. our intelligence\\nand consciousness are our most prominent tools. they compel\\nus all to assemble all the things we know into something\\nmeaningful that makes sense. that is what science has done\\nso far. there are two ways to live your life, either you do not\\nknow that you have never opened your eyes because you have\\nstrong faith in religion or you do not want to close your eyes\\nbecause the beauty of the universe is endless. both kinds of\\npeople find joy in their own beliefs and knowings. however, if\\nany of these scenarios prevent you from asking questions, you\\nmust understand its fallacies.\\n\\n'"

      "conclusions of what it could be:\n",
      "1. our first possible solution for dark energy is that the\n",
      "universe is filled with a changing energy field, also known as\n",
      "â€œquintessence.â€\n",
      "2. another possibility is that our current understanding\n",
      "of gravity is incomplete.\n",
      "our current model of gravity only\n",
      "includes the gravity of matter and dark matter.\n",
      "the force of\n",
      "dark energy could be another part of gravity, just opposite in\n",
      "nature.\n",
      "3. the leading theory, however, considers dark energy as a\n",
      "property of space itself.\n",
      "it predicts that empty space can have\n",
      "its own energy, and this indicates that as more space emerges,\n",
      "more energy is added to the universe, increasing its expansion.\n",
      "early stars and galaxies\n",
      "at the beginning of our universe, stars were formed when a large amount of dust and gases came together.\n",
      "it is not an easy process for stars to shine and show us their bright light.\n",
      "gravity plays a significant role in this process.\n",
      "the early stars started shining as soon as hydrogen started to fuse into helium due to the gravitational force of the star.\n",
      "the outside gravitational force of a star not only provides extra pressure for hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium and other heavy elements but also raises the inner core temperature of a star, which makes the process easier.\n",
      "early stars in our universe used to be very big compared to our sun because their formation took place in the early pure hydrogen clouds.\n",
      "due to gravitational forces, some of those stars kept on adding more and more matter and went on becoming denser and heavier.\n",
      "as they became big, they added more matter to their pile.\n",
      "some of those early giant stars ended up as a supernova explosion creating heavier elements.\n",
      "it is believed that most of the heavy elements such as iron and gold that we use today came from the explosion of those stars that formed soon after the big bang.\n",
      "not all stars exploded into a supernova, some of them contracted under their own gravity resulting in the formation of massive black holes.\n",
      "so now we had a universe full of massive black holes and\n",

      "giant stars; most of which exploded and gave us heavier\n",

      "more and more matter into themselves, forming a giant disk\n",

      "because of their enormous\n",
      "gravitational attraction, all the matter in a long distance also\n",
